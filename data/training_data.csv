"Britain's Rolls-Royce raises 2 billion pounds with rights issue LONDON (Reuters) - British engineering company Rolls-Royce raised 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) from a rights issue on Thursday to bolster its pandemic-hit finances, after shareholders signed up for 94% of the new shares and the rest were sold via a rump placing. Airlines pay Rolls-Royce based on how many hours its engines fly, so the company’s finances have come under increasing pressure after COVID-19 stopped travel earlier this year. The equity raise unlocks new debt options for the company including 2 billion pounds from a bond issued in October and a bank loan worth 1 billion pounds, as part of a total 5 billion pound liquidity package. The overwhelming majority of shareholders backed the equity raise, but the results showed there were some dissenters to the issue from what is one of Britain’s best known industrial names, with 6% of the new shares issued not initially taken up. The company said in a statement that 10 underwriting banks including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had successfully procured subscribers for the rest of the shares. Chief Executive Warren East Rolls-Royce can ride out COVID-19 with the new liquidity package and by cutting 1.3 billion pounds in costs, axing 9,000 jobs and closing factories to adjust to lower demand from airline customers that fly with the firm’s engines on Boeing 787s and Airbus 350s. Shares in the company traded down 8% at 90 pence at 1240 GMT. In the rump placing, the new shares were sold at a price of 90 pence per share, the company said. The stock has had a rollercoaster week.

"Canada's Bombardier faces UK bribery probe over plane sales (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office announced on Thursday it was investigating Canadian industrial group Bombardier BBDb.TO over suspected bribery in airplane sales to Garuda Indonesia GIAA.JK, widening a global anti-corruption drive in aerospace. The plane and train maker is the latest aerospace group to face scrutiny over the use of middlemen after authorities struck a record bribery settlement with Europe's Airbus in January and a 2017 plea deal with British engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L Both settlements involved sales of planes or engines to Garuda and airlines in other countries. “The SFO is investigating Bombardier Inc over suspected bribery and corruption in relation to contracts and/or orders from Garuda Indonesia,” the agency said on Thursday. “As this is a live investigation, the SFO can provide no further comment,” it added. In Montreal, Bombardier said it had been informed about the SFO probe several weeks ago and would cooperate. It has appointed external lawyers to run an internal review. Shares in the company, which also reported results on Thursday, fell more than 3% after the SFO’s announcement. They ended down 1.7%. At the centre of the case, Bombardier said, are five procurement processes involving different manufacturers, including the 2011-2012 acquisition and lease of Bombardier CRJ1000 regional aircraft by Garuda. Bombardier, which has undergone several changes of leadership after costly industrial bets in the past decade, said the SFO was investigating the same transactions that led to a former CEO of Garuda Indonesia being convicted in May. It sold six CRJ1000 regional jets to Garuda in 2012 and simultaneously leased a number of similar jets. Garuda now has 18 of the jets in its fleet, according to its website. Irfan Setiaputra, Garuda’s current CEO, said in a statement on Friday the airline would cooperate with relevant authorities. Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises minister Erick Thohir also said the government would cooperate. An Indonesian court in May handed Emirsyah Satar, Garuda chief executive from 2005 to 2014, an eight-year jail sentence for bribery and money-laundering related to procurement of planes and engines from Airbus AIR.PA and Rolls-Royce RR.L. In 2017, Rolls-Royce agreed to pay more than $800 million (609.7 million pounds) to defer charges after an investigation by the SFO and U.S. Justice Department into alleged bribery of officials in six countries. Airbus in February agreed to pay a record $4 billion in fines after reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors in Britain, France and United States over alleged bribery and corruption stretching back at least 15 years. Under a system of deferred prosecution agreements available to the SFO, companies can be offered the chance to settle cases with a fine and escape corporate criminal charges by helping to investigate themselves and undergoing radical internal changes. Bombardier Chief Executive Eric Martel, who started his role in April, told reporters the SFO had come to Bombardier with its suspicions. “We got contacted a couple of weeks ago and we’re going to offer our support so they can do the investigation they need to do,” he said. “We were not aware of any issue internally,” he added. Under the system of plea bargains used in UK corruption cases, companies can be at a disadvantage if the probe was thrust upon them but win more lenient fines if they bring potential wrongdoing to the attention of authorities themselves. Nonetheless, Rolls-Royce avoided a larger fine by demonstrating what a British judge described as “extraordinary” co-operation even after the probe was instigated by the SFO. Airbus has undergone a radical overhaul of its top ranks since reporting itself to the SFO in 2016. The four-year probe however weighed on sales and relationships with airlines and led to in-fighting over who should carry the blame for using agents. Bombardier has already undergone significant upheaval since 2015 while trying to bring a larger narrowbody jet to market. It completed an exit from commercial aviation this year by selling its money-losing regional jet business to Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T to focus on more profitable business jets.",2020-11-05 00:00:00,-17.091780283866985,decrease
"Rolls-Royce rescue plan flies as shareholders back £2 billion rights issue LONDON (Reuters) - Shareholders in Britain's Rolls-Royce RR.L approved the aero-engine maker's 2 billion pound ($2.61 billion) rights issue on Tuesday that will bolster the company's finances after the pandemic stopped planes flying. The approval of the capital raise boosts the group’s total liquidity by 5 billion pounds by unlocking extra debt options, including 2 billion pounds from a bond issued earlier this month and an extra 1 billion pounds from a two-year bank loan. Airlines pay Rolls based on how many hours its engines fly and a plunge in flying during the crisis has put Rolls’ finances under intense scrutiny. But on announcing the rights issue plan at the start of October, CEO Warren East said securing the new shareholder funds and extra debt would take “any liquidity questions off the table through this crisis”. A statement published on Tuesday showed that 99.5% of shareholders approved the rights issue plan, confirming comments from the chairman earlier that the result was passed overwhelmingly. Shares in Rolls-Royce traded down 1% at 223 pence by 1308 GMT, reversing the 2% rise immediately after the meeting. The stock is up 75% since Sept.30, the day before the capital raise was announced. Overall, it has lost two-thirds of its value this year. Under the terms of the rights issue, investors can buy 10 new shares for every three they own at 32 pence each, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price. East told the meeting on Tuesday that the company had been right to go ahead with the equity raise, instead of waiting. “We didn’t want to put the business and our shareholders’ interests at risk by gambling on what the situation might look like in the middle of next year,” East said. Investors are backing East’s plan to help the company ride out COVID-19 through cost cuts of 1.3 billion pounds, including axing 9,000 jobs and closing factories to adjust to lower demand from airline customers that fly with Rolls engines on Boeing 787s and Airbus 350s. Rolls also plans temporary shut-downs at factories and to reduce working hours and benefits as part of the those cost-cutting plans, the Financial Times reported. The company’s chairman Ian Davis said that Rolls’ successful bond issue last week, when it raised double its 1 billion pound target following strong demand, meant it would not for now need to use an extension of a British government-backed guarantee on another loan. Demand for the bond issue showed “the effectiveness of this equity raise in reassuring debt markets,” Davis said.",2020-10-27 00:00:00,8.95691706419703,increase

"UK's Tempest fighter jet project could support 20,000 jobs, says BAE Systems LONDON (Reuters) - Tempest, the British-led project to build a new fighter jet, could support 20,000 jobs in the country and add 25 billion pounds to the UK economy, said BAE Systems BAES.L as it tries to drum up more government backing for the project. BAE, the UK's Britain’s biggest defence company, British engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L, European missile maker MBDA and Italy's Leonardo LDOF.MI are amongst the companies working on the jet, which is meant to replace the Eurofighter Typhoon from 2040. The initial findings of an independent report carried out by PwC said that over the first 30 years of the project, Tempest would contribute at least 25.3 billion pounds to Britain, and support an average of 20,000 jobs every year between 2026-2050. The team working on Tempest will use the findings to help convince the government when they present an outline business case for the jet towards the end of the year. Securing a successor for the Typhoon will help preserve Britain’s independent military jet capability and provide skilled jobs, said BAE in a Team Tempest statement on Thursday. Since 2018 when Britain launched the project, the economic outlook has worsened. The pandemic has put the country’s finances under huge pressure, meaning Tempest will have to compete even harder for government funds. “Defence programmes like Tempest offer an invaluable opportunity to secure a recovery from the current COVID-19 crisis,” said Paul Everitt, Chief Executive of aerospace and defence industry body ADS.

"Rolls Royce's shares post record week on capital raising push LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls Royce shares on Friday were heading for their best weekly gain since listing in 1987 as the British aircraft engine maker’s plan to raise money to cope with the coronavirus travel crisis triggered bargain hunting among investors. The value of Rolls Royce shares more than doubled in the last week to 228.90 pence, although that is still a far cry from the 690 pence they traded at before the coronavirus outbreak. The company aims to raise a total of 5 billion pounds, including 2 billion from shareholders, to cope with a “worst case scenario”. “(The recapitalisation plan) sets up Rolls-Royce sufficiently to navigate an uncertain recovery and removes any lingering concerns about liquidity - and even solvency,” said Berenberg analyst Andrew Gollan, keeping a “buy” rating on the stock. Worries over a long-haul travel slump reduced Rolls Royce’s market value to just 3.8 billion pounds from 20.5 billion pounds two years back. “There is a clear willingness to go bargain hunting as traders begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.

"Rolls-Royce to raise £5 billion to cope with COVID cash crunch LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L plans to raise a total of 5 billion pounds ($6.5 billion), including 2 billion from shareholders, to cope with a ""worst case scenario"" as the coronavirus travel crisis crushes the British engine maker's cashflow. Airlines pay Rolls based on how many hours its engines fly in their larger jets and worries over a long-haul travel slump have knocked more than 80% off its shares this year, reducing its market value to just 2.5 billion pounds. Rolls, whose engines power the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, said in May it would cut 9,000 jobs as a result of the pandemic and its finances have come under intense scrutiny, which its chief executive said should end with Thursday’s plan. “This is a comprehensive package which will take any liquidity questions off the table through this crisis,” CEO Warren East told reporters on a call. “We wanted this package to provide sufficient headroom even through our worst case scenario,” East said. A rights issue has been mooted as an option since July, but East said Rolls had to first demonstrate its restructuring plan was working before it could tap shareholders. “We couldn’t really have done this much quicker,” he said. Rolls faces what East called a “pinch point” towards the end of 2021 when 3.2 billion pounds of debt needs to be repaid. To pay for the crisis, Rolls’s debt will jump to over 3.5 billion pounds this year from 993 million pounds last year. Worries about its finances have prompted speculation of a government bailout of Rolls, which was nationalised in 1971 and later privatised. But Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith dismissed this, saying: “That’s not part of any of our plans”. Britain’s best known engineering firm is a key supplier to the country’s military programmes, invests heavily in research and development and helps sustain smaller suppliers. Rolls shares were down 11% to 116 pence at 1118 GMT, their lowest level since 2004, after it said that it would raise about 2 billion pounds through a 10 for 3 discounted rights issue. This was fully underwritten at 32 pence per share, it said, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price, which analysts calculated at 54.6 pence. “The raise is coming at a deeper discount than expected and the recovery scenarios presented were more optimistic than the market is currently thinking,” Investec analyst Ben Bourne said regarding Thursday’s share price fall. On the flying recovery, East said Rolls was now able to withstand a downturn which would involve 2021 flying levels at less than half last year’s levels. But long distance flying remains in the doldrums with a second wave of the coronavirus across Europe and airlines cutting back already reduced schedules. Rolls said if long-haul travel did recover, then despite a cash outflow of 4 billion pounds this year it expected to return to positive cashflow during the second half of next year and was targeting 750 million pounds of free cashflow in 2022. Shareholders will vote to approve the rights issue at a general meeting expected to be held on Oct. 27 and conditional upon its completion, additional debt options will open up. Rolls said it intended to begin a bond offering to raise at least 1 billion pounds, while UK Export Finance has indicated it was ready to support an extension of its 80% guarantee of Rolls’ existing 2 billion pound five-year term loan and would support a loan amount increase of up to 1 billion pounds. Rolls also said it had commitments for a new two-year loan facility of 1 billion pounds. Yields on Rolls' bonds edged off their highs, with a 500 million euro May 2024 note trading at 4.93%, well off this week's high of 5.25%. GB181957506=. The new debt follows a plan announced in August to raise at least 2 billion pounds from the sale of Rolls’ Spain-based turbine blade maker ITP Aero and other assets. In July, Rolls’s debt rating was cut to junk by Moody’s, but with the equity raising and disposals, Rolls said it should be able to return to an investment grade rating in the medium term, helping boost airline customer confidence in contracts. “A strong financial position matters a lot to our customers,” said East.

"France urges parts review after Airbus A380 engine blowout PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have called for a review of the design and maintenance of titanium alloy engine parts to ensure they guard against the risks of metal fatigue following an engine blowout on an Airbus AIR.PA A380 exactly three years ago. France’s BEA agency made the recommendation in a final report into the accident in which an Air France jet carrying more than 500 passengers lost the front section of one of its four engines while flying over Greenland, before landing safely in Canada. The move follows a perilous investigation involving a 21-month international aerial and ground search across the ice sheet to find a crucial titanium alloy fragment, buried 3 metres below the surface and just a metre away from a hidden crevasse. The probe focused on the fan hub at the centre of a 3-metre-wide fan at the front of the engine made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric GE.N and Pratt & Whitney RTX.N. The BEA said a recovered fragment had shown tiny fatigue cracks in a titanium alloy called Ti-6-4 and urged regulators - the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency - to carry out a review of design, manufacturing, maintenance and certification processes. “Neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine,” the BEA said. Such recommendations by leading investigators do not have to be followed automatically but typically carry some weight. Engine Alliance said it had already taken steps to address the findings. Airbus said no flaws had been found during inspections of other engines from the same supplier, one of two A380 engine manufacturers alongside Rolls-Royce RR.L. A spokeswoman for Rolls said it was confident the issues associated with the Engine Alliance part “cannot be attributed to any Rolls-Royce engine fan discs currently in service”. Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, the metal’s biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part, and its ability to handle high temperatures. The industry has faced concerns in the past about titanium alloy manufacturing processes following an engine failure. In 1989, a severe engine blowout on a United Airlines DC-10 led to the death of 111 people during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa. That crash sped improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. But some engine experts have rejected any suggestion that there is an industry-wide manufacturing issue. During the operation in Greenland to find the missing A380 engine fragment, French, Danish and U.S. specialists battled problems from faulty generators to storms, buried tents and concerns about polar bears, according to an expedition report. At one point, the team resorted to low-tech methods including bamboo sticks and concentrated juice to mark the snow after their high-precision positioning system failed, but the investigation also spurred development of new sensor equipment.",2020-09-30 00:00:00,-16.809111117198476,decrease

"UK shares up for first time in four days on signs of economic recovery (Reuters) - London-listed shares rose for the first time in four sessions on Wednesday as a surge in house prices to record highs powered stocks of homebuilders, with Barratt jumping to the top of the FTSE 100. The blue-chip index .FTSE and the mid-cap FTSE 250 .FTMC climbed 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively, with homebuilders .FTNMX3720 marking their best day in nearly two months as data showed house prices jumped 2% in August, the biggest month-on-month increase since 2004.

"Breakingviews - Rolls-Royce self-harms by selling family silver LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rolls-Royce’s plans to flog chunks of the family silver look like self-harm. Although the 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) it hopes to raise will please the struggling British jet-engine maker’s lenders, Rolls will be left with a permanent limp, assuming it eventually recovers from the damage caused by Covid-19 lockdowns. The 5 billion pound company is having a particularly bad crisis. Normally, revenue from servicing jet engines accounts for a third of Rolls’ top line, and a far higher proportion of profit. With airline fleets grounded worldwide, service revenue has almost halved, pushing the group to a 1.7 billion pound first-half operating loss. Unwinding a currency hedge added another 1.5 billion pound layer of misery. Chief Executive Warren East’s brave face is starting to show signs of fatigue. Although flying hours are creeping upwards, the company is expecting 2021 hours to be 30% below 2019 levels. And it could get much worse. Under what the earnings release called a “severe but plausible” scenario of further travel restrictions, Rolls might not be a “going concern”. With his corporate credit card all but maxed out, East is having to look elsewhere for cash to keep aloft. ITP Aero, a Spanish subsidiary that makes turbine blades for jet engines, is on the block. It won’t be a seller’s market for an asset whose operating profit slid by more than two-thirds in the last six months to just 10 million pounds. And in terms of corporate synergies, losing a maker of jet-engine turbines inside a maker of jet engines sounds very unhelpful. The alternative to selling assets is selling shares. Current shareholders might balk, especially as the amount needed to stabilise the corporate flight path is greater than Rolls’ current market valuation, according to a JPMorgan analysis. The UK government, which owned the ancestor of the current Rolls-Royce from 1971 to 1987, might need to help. That sort of rescue may not be appealing, especially if it involves a debt restructuring. But selling the family silver only works if you’ve got something else to eat off.",2020-08-27 00:00:00,-4.703554940711459,decrease
"Rolls-Royce to sell assets to boost pandemic-hit finances LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L said it would sell assets to try to raise at least 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) as it battles to shore up a balance sheet ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and slump in travel. Rolls-Royce plunged to a record loss before tax of 5.4 billion pounds ($7.14 billion) in the first half of 2020 and, compounding its woes, finance chief Stephen Daintith resigned, although said he would stay for a transition period. The company said it would continue to look at options to bolster its finances even after asset sales. But asked about a possible rights issue, Daintith said Rolls-Royce had a good level of liquidity and a plan to cut costs. “We’re not going to be drawn on any particular option for strengthening the balance sheet. We’re taking our time, considering carefully,” he told reporters on Thursday. JP Morgan analysts said a rights issue was needed: “In our view only a very major capital raise would put Rolls-Royce on a sound footing.” Rolls-Royce shares dropped 9% in early trading. The stock is down 66% this year, giving it a market capitalisation of 4.54 billion pounds. As the company is an important supplier to the UK government on military programmes, there has been media speculation that Britain could be forced to rescue it. “Probably the most important thing that government can do is help get people flying again,” CEO Warren East said, when asked about potential state help. Planes stopped flying for months in coronavirus lockdowns earlier this year and travel remains at a much lower level than before the pandemic, hitting Rolls-Royce as airlines pay it based on how many hours engines fly. Flying hours were down 70-75% in May, June and July, and the company warned of considerable uncertainty over the timing and shape of a recovery. To boost its coffers, Rolls-Royce said it planned to sell ITP Aero, which is based in Spain and makes turbine blades for jet engines, and other assets to raise at least 2 billion pounds over the next 18 months. The group will also consolidate its aerospace manufacturing facilities into six locations from 11, and said 4,000 job cuts had already been made at its civil aerospace unit of the 9,000 announced in May - part of this year’s 1 billion pound cost cutting plan.

"Rolls-Royce finds cracks in small number of Trent XWB engines LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce RR.L will carry out extra inspections on some of its Trent XWB engines after cracks were found on a small number of them, in a further headache for the company whose finances have been hit hard by the pandemic. Rolls-Royce sought to reassure investors and airline customers on Tuesday that the issue on some XWB engines, which powers the Airbus AIR.PA A350 plane, would not cause significant disruption for carriers or material cost. Sources close to the matter said that the cost to Rolls would be in the low to mid tens of millions of pounds. That makes it much less severe than the Trent 1000 issues, where problematic turbine blades on the engine which powers the Boeing BA.N 787 are set to cost the company 2.4 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) to fix over the 2017-2023 period. The cost of fixing that problem comes as the pandemic heaps pressure on the company’s finances. It is looking at options to strengthen its balance sheet after planes stopped flying, cutting the revenues it receives from flying-hours. Rolls said wear on the Trent XWB-84 engine will be subject to an Airworthiness Directive from regulator EASA, which is expected to be published on Wednesday. The company pre-emptively issued its statement to address “potential speculation”. Morgan Stanley analysts said that there was a high degree of sensitivity around the XWB given that the engine is important to Rolls’s future value, but its assessment was that the issues were not a major concern and it called them “benign”. Shares in Rolls traded up 3% to 273 pence at 1109 GMT. The stock recently hit its lowest level for 11 years. Rolls said that routine inspections had found the wear in one or two blades of the Intermediate Pressure Compressor in a small number of XWB engines which have been in service four to five years. It said there were 100 such engines in service. None of the engines had experienced any abnormal in-flight operations and the issue had not been found on younger engines.

"Rolls-Royce to carry out extra inspections on some Trent XWB engines LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Britain’s Rolls-Royce will carry out extra inspections on some of its Trent XWB engines which power the Airbus A350 airliner. Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that the issue would not cause significant customer disruption or material cost, as it affected a small number of XWBs of a certain age. The Trent XWB-84 engine is set to be subject to an Airworthiness Directive from regulator EASA, Rolls said, because of wear on a small number of Intermediate Pressure Compressor blades found on a minority of engines which have been in service for four to five years. None of those engines have experienced abnormal in-flight operation, it said, adding that it would carry out inspections on all Trent XWB-84s of a similar service life as a precaution. There are just over 100 of them. “Given the limited scale of additional work which we anticipate will be required at existing shop visits to address this wear, together with the availability of replacement parts and spare engines, we do not expect this issue to create significant customer disruption or material annual cost,” Rolls said in a statement. Problems with its Trent 1000 engine which powers the Boeing 787 airliner are expected to cost Rolls-Royce 2.4 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) to fix over a 2017-2023 period.

Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, was beginning to see positive results from a four-year turnaround process earlier this year when the coronavirus pandemic struck, halting air travel and wreaking new havoc on its finances. ValueAct, which invested in the company in 2015 at the height of its turmoil when it issued multiple profit warnings, is believed to have sold its remaining 4.5% Rolls stake in April, the source said.

The British aerospace engineer is expected to pursue a rights issue with new shares offered to existing investors at a discount to the market price, they said. The Derby-based business, whose shares have tanked nearly 60% since early March, is in talks with BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies about the share sale, which could take place in September, two of the sources said. Rolls-Royce told Reuters it was still reviewing options to strengthen its balance sheet but no decisions had been taken. “Our current financial position and liquidity remain strong,” a spokesman said. Jefferies, BNP Paribas and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Moody’s cut its ratings on the UK-based engine-maker’s bonds by two notches to Ba2 from Baa3, meaning its bonds are now regarded as non-investment grade, and also gave the company as a whole a Ba2 rating with a negative outlook. Shares in Rolls-Royce, which have already lost almost two-thirds of their value during the pandemic, dropped 5.7% to trade at 253 pence at 0827 GMT, after Moody’s statement. A Rolls-Royce spokesman called the downgrade “disappointing” but said: “None of our borrowing facilities contain covenants or credit rating triggers that demand early repayment, nor do any of our contracts with airlines. Our current financial position and liquidity remain strong.” CEO Warren East told reporters on Thursday that the company was examining options to strengthen its balance sheet but had not made any decisions. British media reports on Sunday said that Rolls-Royce was considering selling its ITP Aero division which makes parts for the Typhoon fighter jet to help raise cash. Earlier in July, Rolls said it had 8.1 billion pounds at hand even after the first-half outflow. Moody’s said that it expected substantial cash outflows in 2020 and 2021 resulting in materially increased leverage, adding that the timing and extent of a recovery in long-haul flying, which drives Rolls’s bottom line, was another risk, alongside the execution of the group’s cost-cutting plans. “As a result of higher than previously expected cash outflows, Moody’s expects material increases in leverage, and considers that the company faces significant challenges to recover its metrics over the next two to three years,” it said.",2020-07-27 00:00:00,-2.051473284935324,decrease
"Rolls-Royce says no decisions yet on strengthening balance sheet LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce RR.L was still considering all options for bolstering its balance sheet in the wake of the pandemic, CEO Warren East said on Thursday, as he highlighted progress on new technologies to drive future growth. Speaking two weeks after the company said it had burned through 3 billion pounds ($3.81 billion) in the first half of 2020 and was looking to shore up its finances, East said: “No decisions have been made, we are not going to lay out any potential options, we are considering all options.” East was speaking to reporters by video call instead of at the Farnborough Airshow which was cancelled. He said the company was making progress with greener engines and other sustainable technologies to drive future growth. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for large commercial planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, said in May it needed to cut 9,000 jobs as the market for flying will be smaller for years to come. Pressure on budgets during the pandemic has led the company to cut back on its research and development ambitions, said chief technology officer Paul Stein. The challenge of meeting zero emissions targets in aviation and other industries was a big opportunity for Rolls, said East, who said he believed that the impact of COVID-19 would be to accelerate the decarbonisation of the world’s economy. Stein highlighted Rolls’s technology in the urban air mobility market, that is electric-powered flying taxis, and the company said it was an area where it was likely to start seeing new revenue streams opening up within the next five years. Rolls-Royce also has a plan to get mini nuclear plants which it calls “small modular reactors” connected to the power grid by 2029, and has developed hybrid trains which will be in service in Britain shortly. UltraFan, a new aero-engine which will reduce fuel burn by 10% from current models, will be tested next year, said Stein, providing airlines with a more efficient option.

"Rolls-Royce burns through £3 billion pounds, expects more cash outflows LONDON (Reuters) - Aerospace engineer Rolls-Royce burned through 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in the first half as the hours flown by its engines halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and said it expected a further 1 billion pound outflow in the second half. The British company, which makes engines for the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, said flying hours fell 75% in April, May and June, and it had only seen a marginal improvement since. Chief Executive Warren East said Rolls had started reviewing options for strengthening its balance sheet, and it had 8.1 billion pounds at hand even after the first-half outflow. “The COVID-19 pandemic has created a shock across the entire civil aviation industry,” he told reporters on Thursday. “Across the first half of this year, widebody engine flying hours, which we get paid for under our servicing contract, were half of what they were last year.” Rolls has announced at least 9,000 job cuts, mainly in civil aviation. Its defence business had been resilient, East said, while power systems had been impacted in part. East said sites could be cut as well as jobs. Roll’s widebody engine flying hours were expected to recover to about 70% of 2019 levels in 2021, he said, but deliveries were likely to remain subdued. He said the restructuring would drive a recovery in free cash inflow to at least 750 million pounds in 2022. Its shares, which are 58% lower since the start of the year, were down 10% at 260 pence at 1500 GMT. Analysts at JP Morgan said the trading update was “materially worse” than expected. “If there is a second wave of COVID-19 or a slower than hoped for recovery, then it is very possible, in our view, that the UK government will need to step in to save Rolls-Royce,” they said. East said Britain had supported Rolls with export finance guarantees, underpinning a 2 billion pound loan facility, but there was no quick fix for the industry. “The number one thing governments all around the world can do to help this industry is to get people flying again,” he said. Rolls said the first-half outflow included a 1.1 billion pound fall in engine flying hours receipts and deliveries and a 1.1 billion pound hit from the voluntary end of invoice factoring, which it used to align cash receipts with deliveries.",2020-07-09 00:00:00,-7.331472161145458,decrease

Shares in Rolls-Royce, which have lost 57% of their value since the beginning of the year, extended losses to trade down 9.4% at 264 pence at 15.35 GMT. The company said its financial position and liquidity remained strong. Roll-Royce, which makes engines for planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, has been hit hard by the sharp downturn in air travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

"Britain's Rolls-Royce to axe 9,000 jobs in air travel slump LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs, or more than a sixth of its workforce, in the latest blows to the UK economy and aviation industry dealt by the coronavirus pandemic. The company, which makes engines for planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, said on Wednesday it could also close factories as it shrinks to fit the smaller market it expects to emerge from the crisis. Airlines and their supplies have been among the hardest hit businesses by lockdowns to contain the pandemic, with passenger air travel grinding to a virtual halt. Britain, like many other economies, is also bracing for a deep recession, with jobless claims in April leaping to the highest in nearly 24 years. “We have to reduce our cost base and adapt to the new world, matching our capacity with expected demand,” Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East told reporters, unveiling the company’s biggest round of cuts since privatisation in 1987. The 9,000 jobs, out of a global staff of 52,000, will go predominantly from Rolls’s civil aerospace business, which generates just over half of its 15 billion pounds ($18 billion)of annual revenues. Rolls said it was targeting 1.3 billion pounds of annual cost savings, with about 700 million coming from layoffs plus other cuts that could include factory closures. Headquartered in Derby, central England, about two-thirds of Rolls civil aerospace jobs are based in the United Kingdom, East said, adding that was “probably a good first proxy” of where the jobs were likely to be lost. East said Rolls had 16 to 17 major civil aerospace manufacturing locations across the world, including big presences in Germany and Singapore. Consultations with unions will now get underway, with job losses also expected in office support functions. Rolls’ defence unit will be spared, though, as military demand remains robust. Forecasting air travel will not recover for three to five years, East said Rolls was preparing for aviation activity to be about a third less than in 2019. Government schemes to help pay workers had been useful in the short term, with Rolls’ furloughing 4,000 staff under the UK scheme, but the company needs to prepare for a future where its airline customers fly less, East said. The cuts follow a 2018 programme to axe 4,600 jobs, although 1,000 job losses outstanding from that round are included in the 9,000. Rolls has also been grappling with a long-running engine problem which forced airlines to ground planes. Its shares were last down 2%, having dropped 62% this year to 11-year lows.",2020-05-20 00:00:00,5.866958762325281,increase

Satar’s lawyer Luhut Pangaribuan said his client had been given an eight-year sentence and fined S$2 million ($1.4 million) by the country’s corruption court. Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) had indicted Satar, CEO of Garuda from 2005 to 2014, over payments from a businessman via a third party for the procurement by Garuda Indonesia of Roll-Royce Trent 700 engines and Airbus A320 and A330 planes.

"Rolls-Royce signals job cuts as lowers engine output forecast (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce signalled on Thursday it expects to cut some of its workforce, after reports that it was considering cutting up to 8,000 jobs to weather a global aerospace sector slump.

""We have promised to give our people further details of the impact of the current situation on the size of our workforce before the end of this month and will consult with affected employees in due course,"" Rolls-Royce RR.L said.

Rolls-Royce also said it was cutting its forecast for production of widebody plane engines to around 250 widebody engines in 2020, down from its prior forecast of 450, and taking steps to save 1 billion pounds in costs. The company said its civil aerospace widebody engine flying hours were 40% lower than expected for the first four months of 2020, reflecting a 90% collapse in April as airlines across the world ground most of their fleet. “The severity of the disruption caused by COVID-19 is expected to lead to a smaller commercial aerospace market which may take several years to recover,” it said in a trading update. “We must ... take the difficult but necessary decisions to ensure the group emerges from this period with the appropriate cost base,” it said, adding that it would consult with trade unions on any layoffs.

"Rolls-Royce scraps targets, dividend on pandemic hit LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L is scrapping its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances as the British aero-engine maker's customers around the world ground planes due to the coronavirus pandemic. Rolls, one of Britain’s most historic industrial names, which before the coronavirus crisis struck was trying to emerge from a multi-year turnaround plan, has suspended its dividend for the first time since 1987. The company's engines power Airbus AIR.PA and Boeing's BA.N widebody jets but more than 60% of that fleet is now grounded, according to aviation data provider Cirium. Rolls-Royce is paid by airlines based on how many hours they fly. Over the last six weeks, the headwind from coronavirus was about 300 million pounds, Rolls-Royce said, on flying hours which were 50% lower in March and expected to deteriorate further in April. Chief executive Warren East said the company’s focus was on strengthening its financial resilience, and as such it would be looking at cutting its cash expenditure, including reducing salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year. Rolls-Royce also said on Monday it had secured an additional 1.5 billion pound ($1.8 billion) revolving credit facility, bringing its overall liquidity to 6.7 billion pounds, to give it headroom during a potential prolonged downturn. Withdrawing its previously announced guidance for 2020, and noting the ongoing uncertain outlook, Rolls-Royce said its board was no longer recommending its final dividend in respect of 2019, saving 137 million pounds. The company said actions to reduce costs, including on non-critical capital expenditure projects and salary cuts and deferrals for senior managers, would have a cash flow benefit of at least 750 million pounds this year. Rolls-Royce also warned it was anticipating a reduction in engine delivery and maintenance and overhaul volumes, affecting its revenues in the longer term.

"Rolls-Royce targets in jeopardy as pandemic brings air travel slump LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L will likely have to slash its 2020 cash flow target after airline customers parked hundreds of planes due to the coronavirus pandemic, analysts said. Rolls last updated the market at the end of February, when it forecast 2020 free cash flow of 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion), excluding any material impact from COVID-19. The company is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly, and since its update air travel has slumped. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said he could see free cash flow drop into negative territory this year, even with the firm’s 400 million pound cost cuts, based on flying hours which could be down about two-thirds for four months of 2020. But he said the company could withstand that. “Given that Rolls-Royce started the year with 1.36 billion pounds of cash it’s not as hamstrung as I think some people portray,” said Morris, who rates the company a “buy”. Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard, who rates Rolls “sell”, said airlines would likely retire many older aircraft earlier than expected, hitting revenue Rolls earns from spare parts and servicing in its aftermarket business. “While this downcycle is set to hurt all aerospace suppliers, Rolls looks particularly vulnerable in our view. This is a company that was not in the best of financing shape before this downcycle hit,” he said. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said the company had a robust financial position with 7 billion pounds of liquidity at the end of 2019, including a 2.5 billion pound credit facility. “We are closely monitoring the situation and taking prudent measures to conserve cash, such as reducing or deferring discretionary spend. Our good starting position and the measures we have taken, and will continue to take, give us confidence in the ongoing financial resilience of our business,” he said. General Electric Co's GE.N aviation unit, a rival to Rolls in making engines for Boeing and Airbus aircraft, said last week it would cut its U.S. workforce by about 10%. Rolls declined to comment on whether it would be furloughing staff under a British government job retention scheme. According to analysis by travel data firm Cirium, flying hours on Rolls-Royce powered flights reduced from 20,421 hours on Jan. 3 to 4,664 on March 29. Rolls started this year having got to grips with a long-running engine problem and having made progress with a multi-year turnaround plan which had seen it cut costs, and focus on raising free cash flow to 873 million pounds for 2019 from a nadir of 100 million pounds for 2016. It relies on aerospace for just over half of its 15 billion pounds of annual revenues, deriving the rest from its defense and power systems businesses. The company suspended production in its British aero-engine factories for a week last week, and the facilities are likely to return with reduced activity. Shares in the company have dropped 45% in the last month, hitting their lowest level for more than 10 years.

"Make us ventilators to fight coronavirus, UK asks Ford and Rolls Royce LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has asked manufacturers including Ford, Honda and Rolls Royce to help make health equipment including ventilators to cope with the coronavirus outbreak and will look at using hotels as hospitals. Britain, which has reported 55 coronavirus deaths and 1,543 cases, on Monday announced it was ramping up its battle against the coronavirus outbreak, shutting down social life and ordering the most vulnerable to isolate themselves for 12 weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to more than 60 manufacturing businesses and organisations to ask them to help step up the production of “vital medical equipment” such as ventilators for the National Health Service, a spokeswoman for his Downing Street office said. “The Prime Minister made clear that responding to coronavirus and reducing the spread of the peak requires a national effort,” the spokeswoman said. “He asked manufacturers to rise to this immediate challenge by offering skills and expertise as well as manufacturing the components themselves. Businesses can get involved in any part of the process: design, procurement, assembly, testing, and shipping.” Hotels will be used as emergency hospitals, retired doctors are being asked to come back to work and some elective surgery is being cancelled. Many countries are trying to buy ventilators, used to keep people with coronavirus alive if they struggle to breathe. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been an enthusiastic response to the call for ventilator production. “We will buy as many ventilators as are made,” he later told parliament. “It is not a question of putting a target on it, we are just going after as many as we possibly can.” It was, though, not immediately clear how a manufacturer of jet engines or cars could turn to producing specialist medical equipment, which international parts would be needed or what certification would be required. One option could be to adopt defence industry rules which can be used to order certain factories to follow a design to produce a required product quickly. British industry has the capability to do that but is unlikely to make the electronic components that would also be required. Rolls Royce, a British engineering company that makes the jet engines for the biggest Boeing and Airbus planes, said it was ready to help in any way it could. Honda, which built just under 110,000 cars at its facility in Swindon in England last year, said it had been asked by the government to explore the feasibility of making additional ventilators. Ford operates two engine factories in Britain, which made just under 1.1 million engines in 2019. A spokesman said it was assessing the situation. One of the two sites, in Bridgend in Wales, is due to close this year. Peugeot-owned Vauxhall has also been asked to help.

The aviation industry is under pressure to decarbonise, but fully electric planes in the 150-200 passenger short-haul bracket are not expected to be flying before the 2030s. Asked about hybrid electric aeroplanes, Rolls-Royce CTO Paul Stein told a conference he believed regional hybrid planes, usually said to carry about 100 people, could be flying before the end of the decade. “I would hope, the latter part of this decade, we’d see revenue-carrying hybrid electric flight,” Stein said.",2020-03-03 00:00:00,-1.364073427036175,decrease
"Revival gives Rolls-Royce confidence despite coronavirus LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L has got to grips with a long-running engine problem and enjoyed a strong end to 2019, leaving it well placed to cope with any disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak, it said on Friday. Shares in the British engines maker jumped as much as 6.6%, one of the few increases among European blue-chips, as the upbeat tone contrasted with the gloom gripping many other companies - including Rolls’ airline customers - about the potential for coronavirus to trigger a global recession. Rolls has been battling to improve the durability of its Trent 1000 engine, which powers Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, with the blades in the TEN variant proving particularly problematic. Airlines have had to ground the aircraft for repairs. However, Chief Executive Warren East said on Friday the roll-out of fixes was progressing and he had increased confidence in a new blade design due next year. The number of aircraft on the ground for repair would fall to a single-digit by end of the second quarter, in line with forecasts, he said. Rolls reported a 852 million pound ($1.1 billion) operating loss for 2019, largely due to a 1.4 billion pound charge for the Trent 1000. Excluding that charge, core underlying profit rose 25% to 810 million pounds. Analyst Robert Stallard at Vertical Research Partners said the latter came in above the top end of Rolls’ 600-800 million pound guidance, and noted there were no additional Trent 1000 charges in the results. Cash flow increased to 911 million pounds, led by higher profit and 173 million pounds worth of Trent 1000 insurance receipts. East said Rolls delivered a record 510 widebody aircraft engines in the year and secured about two out of three orders for new widebody engines. “Building on the strength of our performance into the end of 2019, we are looking forward to 2020 with some degree of conviction and confidence,” he told reporters. Shares in Rolls, which fell to a three-and-a-half year low on Thursday, were up 6% to 636.6 pence at 1200 GMT. ‘UNKNOWN UNKNOWN’ Rolls, which also has defense and power systems businesses, said the coronavirus outbreak was likely to hit air traffic growth, but long-term trends remained intact. British Airways owner IAG and Finnair said on Friday the virus would hurt their profits. East said the situation was “an unknown unknown”, in reference to both the geographical scale and the duration of the outbreak, and Rolls was not currently able to quantify any impact on its guidance. However, he said all of the company’s facilities were up and running, and its supply chain had not been disrupted, including from China, the source of the virus outbreak where suppliers were going back to work. “Delivery of widebody engines continues as normal,” he said, adding that in its power systems business trading in China was already returning to normal. He said the disease would impact flying hours, noting that 20% of invoiced flying hours in 2019 touched greater China, but added the company would take measures such as cost controls to mitigate any hit. “But we are confident given our performance in the second half of 2019, ... so we think we are better placed than ever to deal with a situation like this,” East said. Rolls currently expects core operating profit to grow by about 15% this year, with at least 1 billion pounds of free cash flow.",2020-02-28 00:00:00,2.5308046299355857,increase

"Japan's ANA orders 15 more Boeing 787 Dreamliners worth $5 bln at list prices SEATTLE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's ANA Holdings Inc 9202.T will buy 15 Boeing Co BA.N 787 Dreamliners worth $5 billion at list prices, it said, the first commercial order announcement for the U.S. planemaker this year as it wrestles with the grounding of the smaller 737 MAX. The deal, which sees Japan's biggest carrier switch from Rolls-Royce RR.L engines to ones supplied by General Electric GE.N, is a boost for Boeing after it posted no January orders for the first time in decades. ANA’s order includes 11 787-10 stretch versions and four shorter 787-9s. It also has options for a further five 787-9s. The first delivery will be in the business year beginning April 2022, the airline said in a news release on Tuesday. In a separate filing, ANA said 12 of the 15 aircraft on firm order would be purchased directly from Boeing and the remaining three from a subsidiary of Japanese trading house Sojitz Corp 2768.T, with which Boeing has longstanding commercial ties. ANA was the launch customer for the 787 programme and is the world’s biggest operator of the planes. The new additions would bring its purchase total to 98, of which 71 are in service. It operates all three models of the plane, the 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10. The order is a blow to Rolls-Royce, which has supplied all of ANA’s 787 engines so far. Problems with the engines which required extra inspections led the Japanese carrier to cancel hundreds of flights in 2018. In London, shares in the British engineering firm fell as much as 1.8%, underperforming a slightly weaker market. “As the 787 becomes a larger share of our fleet size, we have made the decision to diversify some of the components to minimize single source risks,” an ANA spokeswoman said. Air New Zealand Ltd AIR.NZ, a Rolls-Royce customer for its initial 787 fleet, last year ordered GE engines for its latest order of eight planes, meaning it will also operate both types in the future.",2020-02-25 00:00:00,-1.87779241714352,decrease
"Rolls-Royce 'open-minded' on new Boeing mid-market jet study - executive SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L is ""open-minded"" on whether it will join Boeing BA.N in a fresh attempt at addressing the mid=size jet market after pulling out of an earlier effort over timing, a top company official said on Wednesday. Boeing is re-examining plans for a mid-market jet designed to carry 220-270 passengers after a crisis over the grounding of its smaller 737 MAX absorbed its attention in the past year, leaving the door open to rival Airbus to sell its A321XLR. The delay gives Rolls-Royce more time to develop its efficient new Ultrafan engine technology, for which it has started building parts for a demonstrator. “We are open-minded ... and will stay open-minded when we know what Boeing plans to do,” Chris Cholerton, president of civil aerospace at the British engineering company, told reporters at the Singapore Airshow. The comments came a year after Rolls-Royce dropped out of the race to power Boeing’s planned mid-market aircraft, saying it did not want to risk more disruption for airline customers by rushing out a product without extensive testing. Boeing had originally planned a 2025 entry to service for its New Midsize Airplane, but industry sources say any new attempt could result in an aircraft reaching the market closer to 2028. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has said the company is taking a fresh look at the opportunities for a new aircraft. Cholerton also said Rolls-Royce was progressing well in resolving durability issues with its Trent 1000 engine that resulted in dozens of Boeing 787s being left idle. Other members of the 25-year-old Trent engine family are unaffected, he said. “We making good progress with understanding and implementation of those fixes,” he added. Rolls-Royce has said the premature wearing of some turbine blades has reduced the number of flights an engine can operate between maintenance visits, or its durability, but has assured airlines it remains as reliable as before when in service.

"Rolls-Royce gives first look at one-seater electric plane LONDON (Reuters) - British engineering company Rolls-Royce RR.L gave a first look at a one-seater electric aircraft on Thursday it hopes will fly in late Spring next year and become the world's fastest all-electric aircraft. Growing concerns about climate change plus the recent spread of the “flight-shaming” movement on social media, and a promise by the aviation industry to cut carbon emissions, has made airlines hungry for progress on electric flying technology. Aviation accounts for over 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions and passenger numbers are growing but zero-carbon, long-distance planes carrying hundreds of people are still decades away, aviation experts say. Rolls-Royce unveiled the electric plane, which it is building with partners YASA and Electroflight and others and which will target a speed of over 300 miles per hour, at a hangar in Gloucestershire, western England. The white plane has a blue trim and a bulging neck where its electric motor technology sits behind a propeller on its pointed nose. Named ACCEL, the 6.5 million pound ($8.5 million) project will have the most power-dense battery pack ever assembled for an aircraft, Rolls-Royce said, providing enough fuel to fly 200 miles (320 km), or the distance between London and Paris, on a single charge. Over the coming months, engineers will begin to integrate the electrical propulsion system into the airframe before a first flight by an experienced pilot in late Spring 2020 at a location yet to be decided, but possibly in the Welsh countryside. Earlier this month in Canada, the world’s first fully electric commercial flight took off and flew for 15 minutes, but some attempts have been less successful and a battery-powered aircraft crash-landed in Norway in August. Plane-makers Boeing and Airbus are both working on electric planes, say experts, while Rolls-Royce bought Siemens eAircraft, a developer of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems for planes, in June.",2019-12-19 00:00:00,-0.37228463783673144,neutral

"Emirates' Clark says Rolls-Royce needs to sort itself out after engine delays DUBAI (Reuters) - The board of Rolls-Royce RR.L must urgently address its engine performance problems, the head of Dubai's Emirates said, as the world's largest buyer of wide-body jets weighs up who will power its order of Boeing BA.N 787 jets. Emirates [EMIRA.UL] agreed to buy its first 787 Dreamliners in a last-minute, $9 billion deal at the Dubai Airshow on Wednesday, without specifying what engine would power it, while reducing its order for the U.S. planemaker’s delayed 777X model. The 787s, which can take either Rolls or rival GE Aviation's GE.N GEnx engines, will be delivered to Emirates in 2023, a year later than a tentative purchase plan outlined two years ago. That gives Rolls-Royce more time to sort out the durability issues in its Trent 1000 engines before Emirates believes a realistic competition can be held. “Rolls have had a number of wake up calls and they really need to sort themselves out. I think the alarm clock has gone off a number of times,” Emirates President Tim Clark said at the Dubai Airshow. “If I were on the board, I would be looking to recognise the issues... and deal with them immediately, meaningfully, forcefully and drive change,” he told reporters. A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said it was proud that Emirates had chosen to order 50 Airbus A350s, powered by Rolls’ Trent XWB, in a deal announced this week. “We are confident in the reliability and performance of our engines, and in our commitment to meeting the high standards expected by our customers,” the spokeswoman said. “(Emirates) is one of the largest operators of our Trent engines in the world, and we are committed to maintaining our strong relationship with them.” The Rolls-powered version of the 787 has been hit by repeated technical problems, leading to share price pressure and drawing criticism from airlines. The engine maker’s chief executive Warren East said on Nov. 7 that the company would spend more on parts and replacement engines to reduce the time aircraft are grounded while turbine blades are replaced. Clark said that the situation at Rolls was “salvageable” if board acted quickly and accepted the issues they were having. “With the reputation that (Rolls) has for quality engineering and its excellence in the past, they must restore that as the gold standard,” he said.

"GE unit orders 25 Airbus jets including 12 Rolls-powered A330neo - sources PARIS (Reuters) - Leasing giant GECAS, the aircraft leasing subsidiary of General Electric GE.N, has ordered 25 Airbus AIR.PA aircraft including a rare purchase of jets powered by GE's rival engine maker Rolls-Royce, two people familiar with the matter said. The order includes 12 Airbus A330neo jets, for which Rolls-Royce RR.L is the sole engine supplier, and 13 A321XLR long-distance narrow-body jets. It was included in a new Airbus order tally but the name of the buyer was not immediately disclosed. Airbus and GE both declined to comment. If confirmed, the decision by the world’s second largest aircraft leasing company to invest in the A330neo would be a key endorsement for the A330neo programme which has been clawing its way back from a period of weak sales and some cancellations. GECAS has traditionally prioritised aircraft powered by engines made by its parent company General Electric. Decisions to invest in rival technology highlight competition to diversify portfolios in the leasing industry, even though GE is perceived as more closely aligned in the wide-body market with Airbus rival Boeing BA.N. The A330neo is a 250-300 seat upgrade of Airbus’s most-sold wide-body aircraft, the A330, which is offered alongside the slightly larger Airbus A350 family. Both aircraft are exclusively powered by engines from Rolls-Royce. In 2015, GECAS invested in the first A350 by buying the aircraft immediately after its delivery to Qatar Airways and then renting it back to the airline in a sale-and-leaseback deal. But it remains rare for the GE subsidiary to buy Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft directly from the manufacturer. Rolls and GE compete fiercely for engine sales and the A330neo airplane has in turn faced intense competition from the newer Boeing 787, which offers both GE and Rolls-Royce engines. GECAS is widely seen as a candidate for potential sale as GE overhauls its balance sheet through disposals. It has said it aims to invest in aircraft to keep down the average age of its portfolio to 5.5 years from 6.8 years by 2024. In a statement with its monthly order update on Thursday, Airbus said an “unidentified customer ordered 13 A321XLRs in a transaction that also included 12 A330-900 highly efficient wide-bodies”. It is common for aircraft deals to be posted on an anonymous basis before the buyer goes public, often using the publicity surrounding air shows. Planemakers are gearing up for the Dubai Airshow from Nov. 17 which could feature confirmation of demand from leasing companies including GECAS, industry sources said.",2019-11-08 00:00:00,-5.1308364842740835,decrease

"Rolls-Royce takes another $1 billion hit to fix problem engine LONDON (Reuters) - The bill to fix Rolls-Royce's RR.L Trent 1000 engine has risen by another 800 million pounds ($1 billion) as the aerospace group battles to reduce disruption to airline customers that have had to ground Boeing 787 passenger planes for repairs. The British engineer said on Thursday its operating profit and cash flow this year would come in at the bottom of its guidance - both at about 600 million pounds - as the cost of the Trent 1000’s problems rose to 2.4 billion pounds for 2017-2023. Chief Executive Warren East said Rolls would spend more on parts and replacement engines to reduce the time aircraft are grounded while turbine blades are replaced. “We want to get planes back into the skies faster, giving (airlines) much better visibility of when engines need to be serviced and better confidence in scheduling, and providing clarity to investors,” he told reporters. He said the plan meant Rolls could keep its promise of reducing the number of aircraft on the ground to single digits by the second quarter of 2020 and maintain it at that level. The Trent is one of two engine options for the 787, which can also be powered by rival GE Aviation's GE.N GEnx engines. Emirates President Tim Clark said in September he was “a little bit irritated” with reliability issues at Rolls and GE, adding he would not commit to ordering 787s as there was no stability in Rolls’ engine program. East said the Trent 1000 problem was durability rather than reliability, but the company had struggled to fix one issue on blades on the TEN variant. The solution it had found would require additional investment in maintenance capacity across a number of sites and spare engines to reduce disruption, he said. The final fix for Trent 1000 TENs had been planned for next year, but a blade of “acceptable durability” was unlikely until the first half of 2021, East said, and the engines would need to be serviced every four years rather than five. “With these additional costs, a small number of the contracts we have today do flip into loss-making territory,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith said around three contracts would be unprofitable, and the losses made up about half of an exceptional charge of about 1.4 billion pounds it expected to take in 2019. Daintith said he believed the extra costs drew a line under the financial hit from the Trent 1000. Shares in Roll-Royce, which have fallen 7% in the last 12 months, were down 1.3% at 1125 GMT. Jefferies analysts welcomed the clarity. “For both airlines and shareholders, things seem to have been grabbed by the scruff of the neck,” they said. East said Rolls’ other wide-body engines were performing well, with the Trent XWB surpassing expectations. In its Power Systems unit, however, he said a small number of larger projects had been deferred until next year and as a result sales growth this year would to be in the low- to mid-single-digit range. Despite the Trent 1000 problems, East said he still expected 2020 free-cash flow of at least 1 billion pounds and was still confident Rolls could achieve 1 pound per share of free cash flow in the medium term as Trent 1000 costs subside, inventory is reduced and the company becomes more efficient.

"Rolls-Royce hit by further setback to fixing Boeing 787 engines (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L will take longer than expected to fix problems with its Trent 1000 engine, frustrating efforts to get Boeing BA.N 787s grounded by the glitch flying again and knocking the British company's shares. Rolls-Royce, whose engines power large civil and military planes, said on Friday it had sped up turbine blade replacement for some models, leading to additional removals and delaying a reduction in the number of grounded aircraft to single figures until the second quarter of 2020. The company faces 1.6 billion pounds in extra costs and disruption as a result of the engine problem, which is due to the poor durability of components, and the latest delay spells further frustration for its customers and investors. Its shares were down 3.5% at 780.8 pence at 0851 GMT, the largest percentage losers on London's blue-chip index .FTSE. Rolls-Royce, whose customers include more than 400 airlines, 160 armed forces and 70 navies, said in August that it would spend another 100 million pounds to fix the issue. “We perceived a risk that further action would be required, potentially leading to higher costs being incurred ... today’s announcement that guidance for the Trent 1000 cash costs in 2019 and 2020 remains unchanged comes as a relief,” Jefferies analysts, who rate the stock as “buy”, said. Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East said in August that a target of fewer than 10 aircraft on the ground at the end of the year might take a bit longer to achieve as a result of an additional repair load resulting from faster deterioration of a blade on the Trent 1000 TEN. The Trent 1000 TEN is the latest version of an engine that has had a problematic entry into service. As of late February, Rolls said 35 787s were grounded globally due to engine blades corroding or cracking prematurely. “We deeply regret the additional disruption that this will cause our customers and we continue to work closely with them to minimise the impact on their operations,” Rolls-Royce said. Airlines have faced disruptions because of the groundings, with Norwegian Air's NWC.OL strategy switch to prioritise profits over growth hampered by the global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft and long-running problems with Rolls-Royce's engines on Boeing Dreamliners. Singapore Airlines SIAL.SI has also grounded two 787-10 jets fitted with the Trent 1000 TEN engines. Rolls-Royce is keen to avoid further problems with the engine and in March dropped out of the race to power Boeing’s planned mid-market aircraft.",2019-09-20 00:00:00,-4.297355954023549,decrease

"Emirates' Clark says won't take new planes unless engines are truly ready LONDON (Reuters) - Emirates President Tim Clark said engine makers Rolls-Royce RR.L and GE GE.N must improve their reliability, saying the airline would not take new Airbus AIR.PA and Boeing BA.N planes unless they were truly ready. Boeing has pushed back the entry into service of an ultra-long-range version of its forthcoming 777X widebody, in part due to issues with its GE engines. “When they don’t give me those aeroplanes and engines that work - it’s over. Now you produce what you say you will produce and give it us,” Clark said at a briefing in London, adding that the airline would only take planes when they were truly ready. Emirates has 150 777Xs on order and in 2017 ordered 40 787s, and Clark has said Emirates could replace some of the 777Xs with 787s. Clark said he was still keen on the 777x but frustrated by the delay and was unsure as to when it would be resolved. He also said he would not make a commitment on the 787 either as there was no stability in the Rolls-Royce engine program. “I think propulsion is an issue for us, and I’m a little bit irritated... I say you give us airframes and engines that work from day one. If you can’t do it, don’t produce them,” he said. “We would be foolish to start adjusting or coming up with new contracts until we are absolutely sure these aircraft are going to do what they said they were going to do.” He also said that he had been willing to complete a contract for Airbus A330neos and A350s “months ago” but said he had concerns that Rolls-Royce was not in a position to provide the engines “under the rules of the game that I’ve just established.” Clark said that he expected industry air traffic growth to diminish over the next 3-5 years by around 2 percentage points. In a context of slowing global growth, Clark said that Emirates would have to re-evaluate jet orders made 2-3 years ago, but denied engine issues provided a convenient excuse to reassess a backlog of aircraft orders. “Clouds and silver linings are one thing. Was this an orchestrated slow or stop? No it wasn’t”, he said. “This is not an attempt to slow things with a regard to our obligations under contract. It is just a re-establishment of the rules of the game, which I do not think are unreasonable.”",2019-09-04 00:00:00,1.4640538562091523,increase
"Rolls-Royce expects cash flow rise in second-half as engines are delivered LONDON (Reuters) - British engineer Rolls-Royce said a build-up of inventory such as the Trent 7000 engine that powers the Airbus A330neo would unwind in the second half and drive a “significant improvement” in cash flow. Chief Executive Warren East said Rolls was on track to meet its guidance of 700 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds, in cash flow this year, despite its outflow in the first half jumping to 429 million pounds. “We expect a significant improvement in cash in the second half as we unwind inventory built up to support customer deliveries and benefit from improved trading in both Power Systems and Civil Aerospace,” he said on Tuesday. The company has also built up inventory to cope with any supply-chain disruptions caused by Brexit, East said, with the amount spent totalling about 100 million pounds. Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith said Rolls had 50 new engines in its inventory, up from a typical 15. Fourteen of the engines are currently on the Airbus production line in Toulouse. Airbus deliveries rose about 28% in the first half to just under 390 aircraft, putting it on course to beat crisis-hit Boeing, but it needs to hand over about 500 planes in the second half to meets its annual delivery goal of 880-890 airplanes. East has been restructuring Rolls-Royce to ramp up civil aerospace production and cut losses on the sale of its engines, which it later aims to make up through maintenance programmes. Rolls delivered 257 large civil aerospace engines in the six months to June 30, against 259 in the same period in 2018. East said, however, it had made good progress in reducing average large engine unit losses, down by 200,000 pounds to 1.3 million pounds. Rolls’ turnaround has been hampered by problems with its Trent 1000 engines, which has caused airlines to ground Boeing 787s while repairs are carried out. The company would spend another 100 million pounds to tackle the issue, taking the total to 1.6 billion pounds, East said. “We are confident in fixes to the compressor issue, which was what was causing the problem last year,” he said. “This year we have had some further challenges with the turbine section with a small portion of the turbine fleet.” He said a target of fewer than 10 aircraft on the ground at the end of the year might take a bit longer to achieve. Shares in the company were trading down 1% at 806 pence at 0850 GMT, after falling to a seven-month low of 796 pence in early trade. Analysts at Investec said the cash outflow in the period was worse than expected, resulting in a higher hill to climb in the second half. “More importantly, at least 1 billion pounds free cash flow in 2020 is reaffirmed,” they said. Rolls-Royce said its first-half revenue rose 7% to 7.35 billion pounds and operating profit rose 32% to 203 million pounds.

"Indian police open probe into Rolls-Royce's dealings with three state firms NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian federal police have opened an investigation into Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc RR.L, alleging the UK-based engine maker and its Indian arm improperly used a third-party to conduct business with three Indian state-owned companies. In a report published on Tuesday, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also said officials from the Indian companies - Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), ONGC ONGC.NS and GAIL GAIL.NS - may have been involved in improper procurement from Rolls-Royce.

"Rolls-Royce boss laments Brexit distraction at Paris Airshow PARIS (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East said on Tuesday that uncertainties over Brexit remain an unwelcome distraction for the aerospace industry three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union. A delay to Britain’s EU departure and the possibility of it leaving without a deal in October has kept Brexit centre stage at the Paris Airshow, where East said it had dominated a meeting with heads of aerospace companies and a European commissioner. “It’s nuts that at a meeting like we had this morning, when we were meant to be talking about new technologies, dealing with global competition, that instead we spend half the time talking about Brexit. It’s hugely disruptive,” East told Reuters. Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but has failed to do so, with Prime Minister Theresa May resigning after repeatedly failing to pass a Brexit deal. Some leading candidates to replace May suggest the deal can be reopened, although the EU insists it is not open for renegotiation. Brexit has been delayed until October 31 from March 29, and East said Rolls-Royce had spent money on contingency plans for a March departure that it will not get back. The prospect of a “no-deal” Brexit is a headache for the global aerospace industry, which relies heavily on integrated supply chains and parts distribution centres. East said that he was prepared for the possibility, but was unlikely to make specific plans for the October deadline in the same way as he had done for March. “I’m not sure we’re going to spend as much preparing for some deadline that might never happen. It’s just an unnecessary distraction for businesses,” he said. East, who took over as CEO of Rolls-Royce in 2015 after previously running chip designer ARM, has been leading a transformation programme which he said was on schedule. “Everything I can see at the moment suggests that we’re going to tell the market that we’re absolutely on track,” East said ahead of half-year results due on Aug 6.",2019-06-18 00:00:00,0.15435766262403863,neutral

"Rolls-Royce strikes UK's biggest pension deal with insurer L&G LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce agreed Britain’s largest ever transfer of corporate pension risk, announcing on Thursday it would shift 4.6 billion pounds of assets to insurer Legal & General. Companies are increasingly transferring pension obligations to insurance companies to remove the risk of such schemes from their balance sheets. Consultants predict 30 billion pounds worth of UK pension transfer deals this year.

"Rolls-Royce to meet forecasts as Trent costs under control LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce said its ability to fix the Trent 1000 fleet problem within budget meant it remained on track to hit its full-year cash and profit targets. Rolls, which has taken a charge of 790 million pounds ($1 billion) to tackle the early corroding or cracking of engine blades in the fleet, said the cost of fixing the problem remained in line with earlier estimates. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for large civil aircraft and military planes, has been racing to fix the problem which has angered customers such as British Airways and forced the grounding of many planes. That has complicated the transformation program led by boss Warren East. The company said on Thursday that the rest of the business was performing well however, and for the full year it remains confident of meeting its underlying operating profit and free cash flow guidance of 700 million pounds ($913 million), up or down by 100 million pounds. “Our restructuring program has continued to make progress as we aim to bring down commercial and administrative costs, improve our engineering efficiency and drive lasting culture change at Rolls-Royce,” East said.",2019-05-02 00:00:00,2.009174955350625,increase

"Virgin Atlantic posts annual loss for second year running April 10 (Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic on Wednesday reported an annual pretax loss for the second consecutive year, hit by a shaky economy, the higher costs of fuel generated by a weaker British pound and problems with Rolls Royce’s Trent engines. The airline, the 1980s brainchild of British billionaire Richard Branson, fell back into the red in 2017 after three years of profits, as competition intensified and the weakening of the pound added to already rising fuel costs. Best known in Europe for the trans-Atlantic planes it flies with Air France-KLM and Delta, Virgin said its loss before tax and exceptional items was 26.1 million pounds ($34.12 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of 49 million pounds in 2017. Total revenue rose 5.8 percent to 2.78 billion pounds, as passenger numbers grew just under 5 percent to 5.4 million and revenue per customer rose 1.7 percent. The company said performance had suffered from economic uncertainty and the weaker pound - which increases costs because fuel is priced in dollars - as well as the well-documented problems of the Trent 1000 engines used on its Boeing 787 jets. “While a loss is disappointing, our performance has improved in 2018 despite challenging economic conditions and put us on a trajectory for growth and return to profitability,” Chief Executive Officer Shai Weiss said in a statement. Rolls-Royce on Wednesday agreed to an early inspection of some Trent 1000 TEN engines by regulatory authorities, a week after Singapore Airlines grounded two Boeing 787-10 jets fitted with the units. British Airways owner IAG in February chose Boeing 777-9s, rather than a competing package from Airbus in part powered by Rolls, underlining the risks to airlines from the engine issues. Since then the industry has been thrown into chaos by the grounding of Boeing’s new 737 MAX planes after a second fatal crash within six months. The pound fell 5.6 percent against the U.S. dollar, in 2018 as Britain contended with the political and economic uncertainty generated by its negotiations on leaving the European Union. Finance chief Tom Mackay said that while economic factors would continue to challenge the carrier in the year ahead, Virgin Atlantic was in a strong cash position. The results are the company’s first since its acquisition of troubled regional airline Flybe for $2.8 million earlier this year, in a joint bid with Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital.

According to Rolls-Royce, by late February 35 787s had been grounded globally due to engine blades corroding or cracking prematurely. “This blade deterioration is a known issue but it is occurring faster than we expected on some engines,” Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce President for Civil Aerospace, said on Wednesday.

Shares in Rolls-Royce were trading down 0.5 percent by 0751 GMT, underperforming the wider FTSE 100 index. Singapore Airlines grounded its two jets last week after engine checks showed premature blade deterioration. Jefferies analysts said the affected engines were being operated on routes to Japan, Korea and Thailand, meaning they had a relatively high take-off and landing cycle. In February, Rolls-Royce allocated another 100 million pounds to fix the engine problems and raised a related accounting charge to 790 million pounds ($1.03 billion) from 554 million pounds six months earlier, contributing to a full-year operating loss of 1.16 billion pounds.

Rolls Royce gave up 1.1 percent after the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced a proposal to impose tariffs on a list of European Union products as retaliation for EU aircraft building subsidies. The proposed list, which ranges from large commercial aircraft and parts to dairy products and wine, is a retaliation against over $11 billion worth of damage to U.S. industry from EU subsidies to Airbus, Lighthizer said. Meanwhile sterling rose on hopes that Britain would avoid a disorderly no-deal Brexit, with Prime Minister Theresa May due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.

"Rolls-Royce quits race to power Boeing's planned mid-market plane LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce dropped out of the race to power Boeing’s planned mid-market aircraft on Thursday, saying it did not want to risk more disruption for its airline customers by rushing out a product without extensive testing. The move strengthens a leading position in the high-profile contest already held by a transatlantic venture involving Rolls’ arch-rival General Electric, industry sources said, Britain’s Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for large civil aircraft and military planes, wants to avoid a repeat of the problems with its Trent 1000 engine that powers Boeing’s Dreamliner 787. Chief Executive Warren East said he had taken the “very difficult decision” to withdraw from the Boeing competition because it couldn’t make the development of its new UltraFan architecture fit the timetable for the aircraft. Boeing has proposed launching a new mid-sized jetliner to fill a gap between the narrow and wide-body aircraft, with airline operations beginning in 2025. “If you enter into service with an engine that is not sufficiently mature, then you are almost inevitably going to run into lots of in-service issues, lots of customer disruption and lots of incremental costs,” East told reporters. He said, however, that Rolls was still committed to UltraFan, a major new fuel-efficient architecture that will power wide-body jets towards the back end of the next decade. CFM International -- a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran -- as well as Pratt & Whitney are also potential suppliers for the new Boeing jet. Pratt & Whitney recently re-entered the civil market for narrow-body jets and wants to expand to larger ones, but has been hit by industrial problems. In the nearer term, Rolls is still dealing with the costs and disruption of fixing Trent 1000 engines caused by the poor durability of components. “On this issue we have indeed turned the corner,” East said, although he added that the level of customer disruption was still unacceptable. It raised the Trent 1000 charge to £790 million from £554 million at the half year, contributing to a full-year operating loss of £1.16 billion, and allocated another £100 million in cash to the problem. The issue has damaged Rolls’ standing with its big customers. British Airways owner IAG said on Thursday it would order 18 Boeing 777-9s, rather than a competing package from Airbus that industry sources said included the A350, which is powered by Rolls. “I have been frustrated, largely with the performance of Rolls-Royce, not so much with Airbus,” IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said. East, however, said Rolls had an excellent relationship with BA and put the choice down to IAG’s fleet requirements. “I am totally confident we will be continuing to be a major partner with BA for many, many years into the future,” he said. East said that aside from Trent 1000, the rest of the business was performing well, although the large engine deliveries of 480 fell short of its 500 target, in part due to the challenge of stepping up Trent 7000 production. Shares in Rolls were trading down 3.4 percent at 950 pence, underperforming a 1 percent drop in the FTSE 100. The company reported a 8 percent rise in underlying revenue to £15.1 billion and a doubling of operating profit to £616 million.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.8 percent at 0911 GMT, falling for a third straight session and the FTSE 250 was down 0.5 percent. The index was on track for its second monthly gain. Investor sentiment was hit as the White House said President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not reach an agreement at the end of two days of meetings and as data showed factory activity in China shrank to a three-year low in February. Engine maker Rolls-Royce gave up almost 5 percent, on track for its worst day since early December, after it withdrew from a competition to power Boeing’s planned mid-market aircraft. Miners and oil majors were among the top drags on the main index along with British American Tobacco, which fell 2 percent despite posting higher full-year profit and sales. While the margins beat expectations, Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said he had anticipated more detail on 2019 guidance, especially on prices, which may concern some investors. He said total full-year cigarette and new tobacco heating products (THP) fell 3.5 percent, more than the 2.6 percent he had anticipated. General insurer RSA fell 4.3 percent as high weather-related losses and weakness in commercial underwriting hit its annual operating profit. On the midcaps, luxury British carmaker Aston Martin slumped 8.5 percent after its annual adjusted pre-tax profit fell. Its chief executive Andy Palmer said a delay to Brexit would be a “further annoyance”, which would prolong uncertainty. Ready meals supplier Bakkavor slumped 10 percent on track for its worst day ever to the bottom of the mid-caps after flagging that subdued consumer confidence and inflationary pressures have continued into 2019 after reporting weaker-than-expected EBITDA. In other moves, EasyJet, Barclays amd Micro Focus fell as the stocks traded ex-dividend while packaging and paper group Mondi dipped after a cautious 2019 forecast. Outperforming the main bourse was pest control firm Rentokil that added 5 percent after higher annual earnings. The gain put the stock on course for its best day in more than one-and-a-half years.

"British fraud office abandons Rolls-Royce, GSK investigations LONDON (Reuters) - The UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has abandoned two of its largest and longest investigations, into alleged bribery at aero engine maker Rolls-Royce and drugs maker GlaxoSmithKline, in a move described by one lawyer as “extraordinary”. The decision, which comes under SFO Director Lisa Osofsky who took the helm last August pledging to review the agency’s caseload, weed out weaker cases and propel others forward, underlines the difficulties of prosecuting senior executives. “After an extensive and careful examination, I have concluded that there is either insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction or it is not in the public interest to bring a prosecution in these cases,” Osofsky said. Rolls-Royce paid almost 500 million pounds ($650 million) under a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the SFO in 2017, drawing a line under a four-year investigation into allegations of criminal conduct spanning three decades, at least seven jurisdictions and three of the company’s business sectors. Rolls apologised unreservedly after it was found to have paid bribes including a luxury car and millions of pounds of cash to middlemen to secure orders in countries such as Indonesia, Russia, India, China and Nigeria. But a parallel investigation into individuals associated with Rolls-Royce, and the inquiry into GlaxoSmithKline and its subsidiaries, which began in 2014 shortly after the drugs group was fined 3 billion yuan (343 million pounds) in China for paying bribes to doctors to use its drugs, had made little progress. “It is extraordinary the SFO are unable to charge any individual suspects in relation to Rolls-Royce, given the scale of the allegations in the DPA,” said Sarah Wallace, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell. But Wallace added: “It looks like Osofsky is drawing a line under historical cases and wants to stamp her own mark on new cases going forward.” Robert Barrington, a director at anti-corruption group Transparency International, said the decision to drop the Rolls-Royce case could send a message to companies that DPAs were a soft option that give impunity to those who break the law. “It is absurd that yet again a company can admit to bribery and yet neither the bribe payers, nor the management team that allowed the crime to happen, are held responsible,” Barrington said. Rolls-Royce said it had noted the decision and declined to comment further. GSK said it was pleased at the SFO decision and that no further action was required. The SFO, which faced criticisms of serious failings last year after the collapse of a high-profile retrial of former executives from retailer Tesco, said Osofsky had quietly closed a number of investigations since taking up her post. Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer at White & Case, said she deserved credit for making overdue, tough decisions about longstanding cases.",2019-02-22 00:00:00,-0.4074979724734631,neutral

"Carmaker Rolls-Royce urges May to avoid a hard Brexit LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Rolls-Royce called on the British government to avoid a disorderly Brexit and said it was building up some stock, expanding warehouse capacity and training suppliers for customs changes in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe’s biggest trading bloc in under 80 days but a Brexit agreement looks set to be voted down by lawmakers next week, making a no-deal and potential trade barriers more likely. The BMW-owned BMWG.DE brand, which reported record 2018 sales, said that despite the steps it was taking to prepare for Brexit, it was impossible to predict what would happen if there is not a managed transition after March 29. “We are highly dependent on a proper, working frictionless chain of goods and this whole company hinges on just-in-time deliveries,” Chief Executive Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes told reporters. “We urge the government to avoid any hard Brexit,” he said. Asked whether Rolls-Royce, which builds all of its roughly 4,000 cars per year at its Goodwood factory in southern England, would ever make some models overseas, Mueller-Oetvoes said: “This is a no-go,” he said. “Rolls-Royce belongs to Britain, we are committed to Britain.” Sales at the 115-year-old company, which employs just over 2,000 people, rose 22 percent to 4,107 cars last year, boosted by an over 40 percent rise in demand from China, which accounted for one in five purchases. The numbers reflect similarly buoyant sentiment from Aston Martin, suggesting that luxury automakers might buck an apparent slowdown that has hit the likes of Apple and prompted China’s most successful car firm Geely to forecast flat sales this year. “You see more and more self-drivers in the Chinese market, people being behind the wheel particularly over the weekends in the luxury sector ... and that made (models) Wraith and Dawn quite successful in China last year,” he said. “I can’t comment yet on how 2019 will pan out for us in China but so far we haven’t seen dents in our success over there.” Mueller-Oetvoes also said that tax cuts made by U.S. President Donald Trump also helped the business. “This was really fuel for our business last year in the United States,” he added.",2019-01-10 00:00:00,0.7169301672099486,neutral

"Emirates seeks Rolls-Royce A380 engine deal, nothing finalised DUBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Emirates is edging towards a deal with Rolls-Royce RR.L to power its latest Airbus AIR.PA A380 superjumbos but has not yet reached a final agreement, the Dubai-based airline said on Sunday. The fate of a lifeline order for up to 36 of the double-decker aircraft, of which Emirates already has over 100 in operation, has been widely questioned due to inconclusive talks over a separate deal between Emirates and engine makers. “We are getting closer (to a deal with Rolls-Royce) but have not crossed the line yet,” a spokesperson for the Dubai-based carrier said, asked about the status of negotiations with the British engine maker. A French newspaper last week reported the two sides had reached an agreement. Industry sources have said Emirates is unhappy with the performance of Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on A380s already in service and that a shortfall in efficiency has meant Rolls-Royce having to pay hefty penalties. To improve performance and avoid such penalties in future, Rolls-Royce would need to put more R&D spending into the engine at a time when it is mired in delays or reliability problems on engines for the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A330neo. Engine Alliance, a joint venture between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney that until recently had provided engines for Emirates’ A380 fleet, has shown little interest in reviving output. Its parent companies are tackling restructuring at GE and delays on smaller Pratt & Whitney engines, industry sources say. Airline president Tim Clark has reportedly denied suggestions that the airline is slowing down taking delivery of existing A380s, saying delays are due to production problems. “Unfortunately, quite a few of the A380 deliveries have slipped and they are all compressed in the back end of the year in the next two months, so we are taking them now,” he told the Airline Ratings website. Reuters reported last week that there were delays in delivering some A380s to Emirates and quoted one source as saying Emirates did not need them for now and had parked a number as part of efforts to manage capacity. Durability problems affecting Roll-Royce’s Trent 1000 engine have resulted in premature repairs and led to as many as 40 or so Boeing 787s being idle at any time, industry sources say. The crisis has had a knock-on effect on other programmes as Rolls diverts production capacity from the similar Trent 7000 engine, resulting in delays to the Airbus A330neo.",2018-11-04 00:00:00,-0.6714599520383656,neutral
"Rolls-Royce hit by delay to engine for new Airbus jet LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L said on Friday it would deliver fewer Trent 7000 engines this year than initially expected due to production problems, hitting both its shares and those of major customer Airbus AIR.PA. Rolls-Royce shares plunged as much as 13 percent to a 1-1/2 year low of 747 pence after Bloomberg reported the delays. At 1230 GMT, they were down 4.6 percent at 832 pence, while Airbus’s shares were down 2.9 percent at 95.07 euros. Rolls-Royce said in a statement it now expected to deliver about 500 large engines this year, down from about 550 previously, and that it was working closely with customers such as Airbus, which is using the Trent 7000 on its new A330neo jet. The problems come as the European planemaker is itself rushing to meet delivery targets this year. The widebody A330 has historically been a second key source of cash for Airbus behind its best-selling A320, but the latest model has been hit by weak sales and engine reliability problems in testing. “While the production ramp up issues in Q4 (the fourth quarter) are regrettable, such issues in the early stages of a new engine programme are not uncommon in our industry,” Rolls-Royce said, reiterating its financial guidance for 2018. “As we move into 2019 we are confident that Trent 7000 production and delivery volumes will increase significantly to meet our customer commitments.” Rolls-Royce has also been grappling with problems affecting blades on its Trent 1000 engines for more than two years, and last month said it was still managing durability issues within its fleet and was replacing affected parts. The 7000 is derived from the 1000, but Rolls-Royce’s chief executive Warren East said in June the new engine was not affected by the Trent 1000 problems. East said in August the company faced challenges in producing significant quantities of its new engines – 7000s and 97Ks – in the second half, but was well positioned to overcome them. Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a note Rolls-Royce could have to compensate Airbus and airlines. Market sources say the A330neo, a refresh of the A330 launched with fuel-saving engines in 2014 at a time when oil was above $100 a barrel, has struggled to make its mark because of lower oil prices and the popularity of the underlying model. Additionally, Boeing BA.N has been targeting potential customers with its newer Boeing 787, many powered by alternative engines from Rolls-Royce rival General Electric GE.N. Airbus and Rolls-Royce say the A330neo could benefit from a trend towards low-cost, long-haul operations, the economics of which are looking more attractive as oil prices return to $80. But there are continued doubts about a major order from AirAsia AIRA.KL, which is now looking at smaller A321neo aircraft to replace part of its deal for 100 A330neo jets.",2018-10-26 00:00:00,-4.655960550458712,decrease

"'Rolls Royce' of whiskies sold for record $1.1 million at auction EDINBURGH (Reuters) - One of the world’s most sought-after whiskies, a 60-year old The Macallan Valerio Adami 1926, was auctioned for a record 848,750 pounds ($1.1 million) on Wednesday. The buyer was a private collector from Asia who bid by phone, auctioneer Bonhams said. The firm sold one of 12 other bottles with a label by the Italian artist Adami in May this year for 814,091 pounds. Such whiskies are collectors’ items because of their rarity and will probably not actually be drunk, said Martin Green, whisky specialist at the auctioneer. “It’s the Rolls Royce of malts,” he said. “Obviously we don’t know what will happen to it, but anyone who can spend around a million pounds for a bottle of whisky could afford to drink it. But it’s an object of beauty in its own right - almost a museum piece.” Just 24 bottles of the whisky, bottled in 1986, were produced by Macallan, among the best-known Speyside distillers of Scotland’s flagship product. It commissioned Adami and Peter Blake, known for co-designing the album sleeve for The Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”, to each design labels for 12 bottles. It is not known how many of Adami’s still exist. One is said to have been destroyed in an earthquake in Japan in 2011, and it is believed that at least one of them has been opened and drunk.",2018-10-03 00:00:00,-1.5653551725800543,decrease
"Rolls-Royce facing fresh issues on Trent 1000 engine (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L said on Thursday that turbine blades of its problematic Trent 1000 engines were wearing out faster than expected, grounding additional Boeing Co BA.N 787 widebody jets for early repairs. Rolls-Royce said the issue may cause “additional short-term disruption” to customers in some cases, dealing a fresh blow to an engine program that has been dogged by design issues for the past two years. The exact number of engines assigned for earlier-than-expected repairs related to the turbines blades on Rolls-Royce’s package C series engines was not certain, but it could be as many as 30 or 40, a spokesman said. That is a small slice of the total Trent 1000 fleet. “The guidance issued today is part of our ongoing management of the intermediate pressure turbine blade issue and applies only to the minority of engines which have not yet had replacement turbine blades fitted,” the spokesman said. The problematic turbine blades were already slated to be replaced, but were discovered to be deteriorating faster than expected, the spokesman said. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is expected to publish a formal requirement for repairs in the coming weeks, he said. EASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said safety remains the top priority as Rolls-Royce completes the replacement of intermediate pressure turbine blades on Trent 1000 engines. “Rolls-Royce already has replaced the blades on a majority of engines,” Bergman said. “Our team is fully engaged with Rolls-Royce, and deployed worldwide with customers to mitigate service disruption.” Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, Chris Cholerton, said over the summer that problems with the Trent 1000 engine had left some Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes grounded. Separately, the compressor in the Trent 1000 package C engines is also not lasting as long as expected, requiring inspections and forcing airlines to ground aircraft while the checks take place. Some 380 of the affected engines are in service.",2018-09-27 00:00:00,-0.3029079086532817,neutral

"Rolls-Royce upgrades forecasts despite engine trouble LONDON (Reuters) - British engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L upgraded its 2018 guidance on a stronger than expected performance across its business, saying that it could cope with the rising cost of fixing a problem with its Trent 1000 engines. The company, which makes engines for large civil aircraft, military planes, ships, trains and for other industrial uses, said that both profit and cash flow would come in at the upper half of a guided range this year. Shares in Rolls gained 4.4 percent to 1,031 pence at 0827 GMT, having reversed earlier losses to reach their highest level for over four years. They are up 24 percent in the year to date against a 0.9 percent fall in Britain's bluechip index .FTSE. The upgrade to guidance comes despite the huge costs Rolls is incurring from durability issues with parts on its Trent 1000 engine which powers the Boeing BA.N Dreamliner 787 jet and that has left some planes grounded, angering airline customers. Chief Executive Warren East has said Rolls was working to fix the problem. He has spent the last three years overhauling Britain’s best known engineering business, restructuring, selling-off parts and cost-cutting, most recently announcing in June that 4,600 jobs would be axed, and in July that it would sell its commercial marine unit. His plan to make the business more profitable appears to be working. The company said on Thursday that it now expected 2018 free cash flow to come in between 450 and 550 million pounds, compared to previous guidance for 350 to 550 million pounds, and operating profit to come in between 400 and 500 million pounds, up from 300 to 500 million pounds. “Basically what we’re seeing is good performance across all of our business,” East told reporters on Thursday. Rolls confirmed it was on track to meet the mid-term targets it laid out at its capital markets day in June, including a plan to exceed a target of generating free cash flow of 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) by 2020. “Our immediate reaction to the first-half results is that the Trent 1000 bad news is outweighed by good progress on the metrics that really matter to the equity story,” Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said. The company raised its estimates of how much fixing the Trent 1000 problem and compensating airlines would cost next year. It had said that costs would fall next year, but its new estimate put the hit at 450 million pounds, the same level as this year. Rolls estimated that in total up until 2022, the Trent 1000 and related issues will cost it about 1.3 billion pounds, with it stating on Thursday that it would recognize 554 million pounds of that as an exceptional charge. “This is just how we account for those cash costs,” said CFO Stephen Daintith. “Forty percent of that we’re accounting now as one off exceptional cost in 2018 as a multi-year provision.” Despite the Trent 1000 challenge, the civil aerospace division, the company’s largest unit which accounts for half of all revenues, posted improving results in the first-half. Airlines flying more hours boosted the division, as well as a reduction in the cash loss it incurs from selling engines. An improving defense margin also helped results, as did strong growth across all the target markets for its power systems business, which sells engines used on ships, yachts, trains, trucks, mining, nuclear power stations and in providing back-up power for data centers and hospitals.",2018-08-02 00:00:00,10.75116554870823,increase

"Rolls-Royce looks to robot snakes and beetles for engine upkeep FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L is exploring the idea of using robots inspired by snakes and cockroaches to help it inspect and repair engines in the future, the company's researchers said at the Farnborough Airshow. The plan is part of efforts by Rolls to carry out as much maintenance as possible while the engine is on the wing of a plane. Removing engines from wings incurs disruption for airlines, and so doing more maintenance while the engines are in place saves time and money for airlines, and also reduces costs for Rolls-Royce as the maintenance provider. In one early-stage technology, Rolls-Royce is looking at using a snake-style robot to deposit a set of miniature robots into the center of an engine to carry out a visual inspection. The mini robots resemble small scuttling beetles, and are inspired by cockroaches. James Kell, on-wing technology specialist at Rolls, said they could help get the time taken to carry out a visual inspection of hard to reach areas down from hours to minutes. “There’s lots of things that aren’t ready yet, there’s more work to do yet to get this more mature,” Kell said, such as working out how to safely get the robots out of the engine again. In another technology, Rolls has developed a boreblending robot that can be remotely controlled, for complicated maintenance tasks that typically require specialists. Instead of sending a specialist engineer to the wing, the machine can be fitted to the engine by a local team. A Rolls specialist engineer at its base in Derby would then take control of the robot remotely and direct it. “The aim is to service engines within hours rather than days,” Kell said.",2018-07-18 00:00:00,1.241352477509393,increase
"Rolls-Royce, frustrated at Brexit process, says stockpiling of parts could start in months FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce could start stockpiling parts in months if it looked like Britain was heading towards a disorderly exit from the European Union, the CEO of the UK engine-maker said, expressing frustration with the lack of clarity on the Brexit process. Britain is due to leave the EU in less than nine months, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading block, creating a headache for companies that rely on the smooth flow of goods and parts across borders. Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East said the uncertainty meant the company was having to plan for all scenarios, including a disorderly or “no-deal” Brexit, where Britain would crash out of the EU without an agreement on future trading relations. Asked by reporters at the Farnborough Airshow whether contingency plans meant Rolls-Royce had needed to stockpile parts, East said: “Not yet, but we might have to.” He said the point that might have to begin was months away, adding: “Probably in Q4 this year.” While UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday published her blueprint for relations with the EU after Brexit, a so-called White Paper, she first needs to win the support of lawmakers for the plan, and then win agreement from the EU. East said the White Paper had been “incrementally positive”, but there were still many unknown factors, and that a vote in the lower house of Parliament on Monday represented a step back. May won a series of votes in the House of Commons, but only after bowing to pressure from Brexit supporters in her party to make amendments to the plans. “It was very frustrating that having done a few interviews yesterday and talked about how incrementally positive it (the White Paper) was, at least half of it was undone,” East said. “We can’t rely on anything,” he added. Companies with large presences in Britain, such as carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and planemaker Airbus AIR.PA, which makes the wings for all its passenger jets in Britain, have issued warnings about the risk to jobs and investment from Brexit. Airbus said earlier this month its production could stop in the worst case scenario. One of the major demands of the aviation industry is that Britain retains access to the European Aviation Safety Agency which issues safety approvals for all parts and planes. Rolls, one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, laid out contingency plans in April to ensure there was no interruption in engine deliveries by moving the design approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany. Another part of Rolls’s planning has been to start taking a closer look at its supply chain and in particular the smaller companies, which Rolls’ representatives have been visiting to make sure they are ready to cope with a no-deal Brexit. “We’ve started to engage in conversations with them (smaller suppliers) and looking at where some of the hotspots might be.

The affected Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engines are used on ANA's Boeing Co BA.N 787 Dreamliner jets, the Japanese airline told reporters on Wednesday. A compressor problem in the Trent 1000 package C engine has already led to planes being grounded by airlines such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic [VA.UL] and Air New Zealand AIR.NZ. In June, Rolls Royce said it had found the same issue on a ""small number of high life Package B engines"".

"Boeing sales chief says Rolls setbacks not impacting 787 sales PARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - Engine problems at Britain’s Rolls-Royce have “rattled” the aviation industry but have not slowed sales of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing Co’s commercial sales chief said.

"Rolls-Royce takes wing as CEO sets ambitious goals LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L said it would exceed its 2020 guidance as it announced new ambitious mid-term goals, sending its shares to four-year highs and reflecting investor faith that CEO Warren East can transform Britain's best known engineering firm. The maker of engines for civil planes, military jets and ships has been in turnaround mode since 2015. Having on Thursday announced plans to cut 4,600 jobs as part of cost-saving measures, it told shareholders on Friday the foundations were in place for it to deliver higher returns in future. Rolls said it was well placed to exceed a target of generating free cash flow of 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) by 2020. In the mid-term it is aiming for free cash flow per share to exceed 1 pound, up from 15 pence per share it made in 2017. East told investors that while the targets were just “power point” now, he was confident Rolls would make them. “It is really all about the execution. I believe we now are prepared to execute, we’re capable of executing and we’re determined to do so,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith went further when asked by analysts and said that free cash flow could reach 1.2 billion pounds by 2020. Shares in Rolls traded up almost 10 percent at 971 pence at 1315 GMT, having earlier hit their highest level for four years, showing investors belief that East can deliver. The former boss of chip designer ARM, East, took over Rolls three years ago when the company was laid low by multiple profit warnings due to declines in the oil price and older aero-engine programs. His plan, to simplify the company and make it more efficient, has been taking shape over the last three years, with the most radical action taken on Thursday when he announced job cuts designed to save 400 million pounds a year by 2020. Despite Rolls's confidence, the engineering company remains under pressure in the near term from airline customers due to ongoing issues with parts not lasting as long as expected on the Trent 1000 which powers the Boeing BA.N 787. The CFO cautioned that such issues were risks to the potential for reaching 1.2 billion pounds of free cash flow in 2020. “We’re in the middle of managing pretty significant issues on the Trent 900 and 1000, and how that evolves, that’s a risk around the business so don’t treat that as a hard and fast number,” Daintith said. The new targets would represent the culmination of East's turnaround of the company, and are designed to answer critics who have long said that Rolls underperforms rivals such as GE GE.N, which are more profitable. The higher free cash flow target also raises the prospect of a bigger payout for shareholders after the dividend halved in 2016. Since then Rolls has said any improved shareholder returns will be linked to its free cash flow performance. The jump in the share price reflects the material upgrade to consensus figures implicit in the new targets, said analysts. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said that free cash flow per share of over 1 pound, was equivalent to total free cash flow of 1.9 billion pounds. “It’s told us that in the mid-term, that’s about four years or five years, it (Rolls) can do 1.9 billion pounds. If it does that then it’s a cheap stock,” he said. Morgan Stanley analysts praised the company and its leadership, saying the new targets showed a “ruthless focus on optimising investment” and “the emerging benefits of increased focus and rigour”. East’s plan has involved dividing the company into three business units, Civil Aerospace, Defence and Power Systems, with the latest restructuring designed to remove management duplication between the three new units. Rolls on Friday also showcased its often-overlooked power systems unit, saying that the business will drive some of its future growth by achieving revenue growth of 3 to 5 percent above underlying GDP, and an operating profit margin in the mid-teens, up from 11.3 percent in 2017. Power systems makes high and medium-speed diesel and gas engines that are used on ships, yachts, trains, trucks, mining, nuclear power stations and in providing back-up power for data centers and hospitals. Rolls said on Friday the Trent engine issue could lead to additional cash costs of 100 million pounds in 2018, but that it was sticking to guidance for this year’s free cash flow to come in at about 450 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds. It said it would be able to offset those costs through “short-term discretionary cost mitigation actions”. Asked if the Trent 1000 issues could also become problems on other engine programs, the Trent XWB and the Trent 7000, East said he was confident that would not happen.

"Breakingviews - Rolls-Royce investors wisely keep the seat belt on LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rolls-Royce investors are keeping their seat belt fastened despite the promise of an increasingly smooth journey. The British plane engine-maker aims to generate 1 pound of free cash flow per share over the mid-term, quadruple this year’s estimate. Despite the bullish new target, shareholders don’t look to be pricing it in fully. A distant horizon and history of one-off costs suggest why. If “mid-term” means “in five years’ time” – at the shorter end of company guidance on Friday - Rolls-Royce’s valuation doesn’t look excessively generous even after a 9 percent bump in its share price on June 15. Assume the company can generate the 1.9 billion pounds of free cash flow it says it can, by end-2023. On a typical free cash flow yield for the sector of 6 percent, that would imply its shares should be worth over 16 pounds. Discounted back at Rolls-Royce’s 8.3 percent cost of capital as estimated by UBS, the shares would fetch over 11 pounds, tangibly above their current 959 pence. Warren East has disclosed the rationale for the cash bonanza. The Rolls chief executive expects a big boost from reducing the loss the company makes when it sells engines to airlines, from 1.6 million pounds today to 400,000 pounds by 2022. Buying parts from Mexico rather than Spain and negotiating better buying terms from suppliers reduce the overall cost of producing engines. Meanwhile, an extra 2000 units by 2022 means more flying hours – which is when Rolls-Royce claws back the initial loss on the engine sale. Lowering the cost of so-called shop visits, or plane maintenance, will also help. Investors may buy all this, but think the slightly nebulous timeline could slip a bit. They are also probably wary of one-off costs. The company itself pointed to risks inherent to the business, such as expensive problems that have bedevilled its Trent 1000 engine model. If East wants to make his shareholders more bullish, he could divert some of the cash pile into dividends. Rolls-Royce cut its dividend payout in 2016. One way to make his share price rise further would be to display his confidence in his latest cash predictions.",2018-06-15 00:00:00,5.052111079095307,increase

"Rolls-Royce cuts 4,600 jobs at 'pivotal moment' for business LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L is to cut 4,600 jobs over two years in the latest attempt by boss Warren East to reduce costs and complexity and make Britain's best known engineering company more profitable and dynamic. East, a softly-spoken former tech boss, has overhauled the 134-year-old Rolls since he took charge in 2015 but the new cuts come as the group grapples with an aero-engine problem that has grounded planes and angered clients. The announcement, which East said is not linked to the Trent 1000 engine issue, marks the biggest round of job cuts since the company had to retrench during the aviation crisis that followed the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001. The plan will remove 10 percent of the workforce, targeting duplication in corporate, administration and management roles to try to save 400 million pounds ($536 million) a year by 2020. Two thirds of the job cuts will fall in Britain. Rolls is the biggest employer in the city of Derby, central England, with 15,700 at its headquarters. “Rolls-Royce is at a pivotal moment in its history,” East told reporters. “We are poised to become the world leader in large aircraft engines. But we want to make the business as world class as our engineering and technology. “We are proposing the creation of a much more streamlined organization. We have to significantly reduce the size of our corporate center, removing complexity and duplication that makes us too slow, uncompetitive and too expensive.” The cuts will not affect its engineers, Rolls said. The news has echoes of an announcement from BT BT.L last month, another venerable company that is cutting 13,000 managerial and back-office jobs to reduce bureaucracy and respond faster to its customers' needs. East, who built the chip designer ARM Holdings from a start-up into Britain's biggest tech company, has complained that Rolls, a rival to General Electric GE.N, is too complex and cumbersome due to layers of bureaucracy above the shopfloor. Driving home his new focus, he has set a 2020 free cash flow target of 1 billion pounds, a sizeable jump from the 273 million pounds recorded in 2017, off revenue of 15 billion pounds. In January he divided the company into three business units - Civil Aerospace, Defence and Power Systems - and the new restructuring is designed to remove management duplication between those layers and the corporate center. The cuts follow a lengthy period of investment in previous years that has meant it is now delivering its biggest ever increase in large engine production. The union Unite warned: “There is a real danger that Rolls-Royce will cut too deep and too fast with these jobs cuts, which could ultimately damage the smooth running of the company and see vital skills and experience lost.” The major restructuring, costing a total of 500 million pounds between 2018 and 2020, will be reported as separate one-off costs, allowing it to stick to its targets for free cash flow. “These changes will help us deliver over the mid and longer-term a level of free cash flow well beyond our near-term ambition,” East said. The company holds an investor day on Friday where it is expected to provide more details on its targets and outlook. Asked about the potential sale of the company’s commercial marine business, which supplies oil and gas customers and is under review, East said he would provide shareholders with a “short update” on Friday. Investors will also be looking for hints that the dividend could start to grow. It was halved in 2016 to enable the company to shore up its finances and cope with the declines in its aero engine and oil and gas businesses over the previous two years. Rolls shares traded 3 percent higher to 854 pence by 1055 GMT after it published details of the restructuring plan. The rise came despite analyst concerns about Rolls excluding the costs of restructuring from its the free cash flow targets. “In our view on first pass the headlines imply a notable underlying downgrade to current market expectations in outer-year estimates with higher than anticipated costs in the near term,” Barclays analyst Phil Buller said in a note. “How much of this is driven by the growing Trent 1000 issues is unclear.” The overhaul will test East’s management skills however, coming against a backdrop of huge pressures on the group which has been blindsided by problems with parts of the Trent 1000 engine which powers the Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet. Having discovered that parts of the engine were not lasting as long as expected, the company is having to ground planes to carry out inspections, forcing airline clients to lease alternative planes to meet demand in the busy summer period. That program has pushed up costs, increasing pressure on Rolls to find savings elsewhere. East said the job cuts were not linked to the engine problem. “The people that will be leaving the business have nothing whatsoever to do with solving the issues our customers are having with our engines today,” East said. “I know it sounds incongruous at face value, the loss of the work force while we’re dealing with these issues but they’re really two separate issues altogether.” Rolls-Royce has 55,000 employees worldwide, of which 26,000 are in Britain.

"Rolls-Royce, preparing to cut thousands of jobs, says engine problem has spread LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce RR.L said a costly compressor problem that had grounded Boeing planes had now been found in a different type of engine, compounding pressures on a group that is due to cut more than 4,000 jobs this week. Britain’s best known engineering company has been hit by a problem with a compressor in the Trent 1000 package C engine that is not lasting as long as expected, grounding planes, forcing inspections and angering airline clients. The engine powers Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jet. On Monday it said it had now found the same issue on a “small number of high life Package B engines”, requiring a one-off inspection of the B fleet and sending its shares down 1 percent. The news, which will not affect Rolls’ full-year free cash flow target, comes as the group embarks on the latest stage of a major restructuring program under Chief Executive Warren East that is designed to boost profitability. On Friday the group will host a capital markets day where, according to a person familiar with the situation, it will announce more than 4,000 job cuts, mostly in Britain and affecting support and management roles. The group, which employs 50,000 people in 50 countries, is also expected to set out how it will make a return on the investment made in recent years and the expected drivers of cash flow beyond its medium-term horizon. The news about the compressor issue will not help however as Rolls has been fighting to show it has a lid on a problem which has forced airline customers to lease alternative planes to fly in the busy summer holiday period. The existing package C issue had led to about 30 of the affected aircraft being grounded at any one time for checks. They were flown by airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand AIR.NZ. Air New Zealand said earlier this month it would lease two Boeing 777s to cover for 787-9s that are affected by the Rolls engine issue. Airlines that use the package C engine tend to also take the package B engine. According to Rolls some 380 package C engines are in service while there are 166 package B engines in service. Rolls said that while this new problem would incur some additional cost, it did not expect it to affect its free cash flow guidance for 2018. Analysts welcomed the fact the group did not revise the target and noted the comment that the package B issue only affected a “small number” of engines.",2018-06-11 00:00:00,0.7182187966994839,neutral

"Rolls-Royce says tripling capacity to fix Trent 1000 engine problems LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce RR.L said it would add maintenance facilities and people to triple its capacity to fix problems with Trent 1000 engines that have grounded Boeing Dreamliner planes, but said this would not raise the cost of the work. The compressor in the Trent 1000 package C engines that power Boeing's BA.N 787 Dreamliner jet is not lasting as long as expected, requiring inspections and forcing airlines to ground aircraft while the checks take place. That has led to complaints from some of Rolls’s airline customers as they must lease alternative planes to fly in the key summer holiday period, putting extra pressure on the engineer to speed up the process. Rolls said in a statement on Wednesday that it had a new inspection technique that meant it could check engines without removing them from the wings to help it meet a safety regulator’s deadline of June 9 for completing initial checks. About 30 of the affected aircraft, flown by airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand AIR.NZ, are grounded at any one time for checks, Rolls has said, and this is expected to peak at around 50 as inspections intensify as the deadline looms. The Trent 1000 issues are a blow for Rolls’s CEO Warren East, who has led efforts over the last three years to simplify Rolls to try to offset declines in older aero-engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment. The company is due to hold a capital markets day on June 15. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said Rolls’s response to the problem was positive. “The bit in today’s statement that I think is most important is the pace at which Rolls-Royce is responding to this,” the analyst who has a “buy” rating on the stock said. Shares in Rolls traded down 0.7 percent at 820.8 pence, lagging the blue chip index .FTSE which was up 0.2 percent at 1150 GMT. Rolls said it was using its “full resources” to address the Trent 1000 issue. “We are drawing on resource from across Rolls-Royce and have redeployed engineers and other experts to address the issue, growing the team by more than 200 people,” a company spokesman said. The financial implications of the problem had not changed from April, Rolls said. Rolls has said that the cash hit from the Trent problems should hit a peak of 340 million pounds in 2018 before falling in 2019, with the cost of the extra inspections covered by cutting discretionary spending elsewhere. Rolls has guided that 2018 free cash flow will come in at about 450 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds, which analyst Morris said gave the company enough leeway to withstand the Trent 1000 problems as long as they did not worsen. Some 380 of the affected engines are in service. About one third of these need some form of repair work, according to media reports which have not been disputed by the engine maker. Repairs take weeks. Engines that are given the all clear return to flying but are subject to further checks under safety rules which only allow the engines to be flown a certain number of times before repeat inspections are required. Beyond the inspections, Rolls has been working to develop a replacement part to provide a permanent fix. It said this would be tested in early June and it aimed to have the part ready to install by later this year, bringing forward the date from 2019. Rolls’s efforts to date have not been enough to satisfy some airlines. IAG ICAG.L, owner of British Airways, may have to ground five or six 787 Dreamliners with Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines this summer and Chief Executive Willie Walsh said earlier in May he was disappointed by Rolls-Royce's response.",2018-05-29 00:00:00,-2.5373515996010965,decrease

"Rolls-Royce operations chief to leave in streamlining (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc RR.L Chief Operating Officer Simon Kirby will leave the company in June as the British manufacturer looks to streamline its business, it said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters. “As we update our organisation and move to more empowered business units with a much leaner centre, it has become clear that we no longer need the Group Chief Operating Officer role for which Simon Kirby was recruited in autumn 2016,” Chief Executive Warren East said in the memo. East has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment. As part of those efforts, East said Rolls also needs a smaller, more cost-effective headquarter in London and the company would be talking to employees at its current headquarter in Buckingham Gate about the options being considered. Kirby joined the group in 2016 from British high-speed rail project HS2 to take up a newly created post and was tasked with a “group-wide transformation agenda.” “I want to thank Simon for his huge contribution to reducing central costs as part of the transformation programme, despite in doing so, working himself out of his own role,” East said.

"Rolls-Royce says working quickly to fix Trent 1000 problems LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce is working quickly to repair problems with some of its Trent 1000 engines that have left planes grounded, it said on Thursday, adding it remained confident the cost would not cause it to miss financial forecasts. Rolls-Royce RR.L was questioned at its annual shareholder meeting about problems with the Trent 1000 package C, the engine used to power some Boeing BA.N Dreamliner 787 planes, in what is a new headache for a company in turnaround mode since 2015. It has said the problems will be fully resolved by 2022. But Chief Executive Warren East, tasked with improving profitability at one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, said on Thursday he expected the issue of grounded aircraft to be sorted out much sooner than that. “Based on where we are at the moment, we would expect to remove the aircraft on the ground situation much, much faster than 2022,” East told shareholders. Despite the higher costs of additional inspections announced in April, Rolls has kept its 2018 free cash flow guidance at around 450 million pounds ($643 million), give or take 100 million pounds. The company reassured investors again on Thursday it was on track to meet that target, as well as its profit forecast. Rolls shares were last down 0.8 percent at 829.8 pence. The problem with the Trent 1000 package C engines is that turbine blades are not lasting as long as expected, requiring extra inspections and meaning airlines are having to ground some aircraft. There are 380 package C engines currently in service with airlines such as Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic [VA.UL], and estimates put the number of grounded planes at any one time at about 30. Rolls chairman Ian Davis told the meeting that fixing the problem was: “The absolute priority for the board, the absolute priority for the company.” It was not clear whether Rolls could face any legal action as a result of the problems. When asked that question, East replied: “Our priority right now is getting customers like Air New Zealand flying reliability.” Rolls has guided the cash hit from the Trent problems should hit a peak of 340 million pounds in 2018 before falling in 2019, with the cost of the additional inspections covered by the company removing discretionary spending elsewhere. East said the cost guidance included possible compensation for airlines, without giving more details. Asked about the potential sale of the company’s commercial marine business, which supplies oil and gas customers and is under review, East said he hoped to be able to provide an update at a capital markets day on June 15. “It’s an ongoing process,” he said.",2018-05-03 00:00:00,-0.11950286978254594,neutral

"Ship tech firm Wartsila misses earnings expectations; eyes Rolls-Royce unit HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish ship technology and power plant maker Wartsila WRT1V.HE missed first-quarter earnings expectations on Tuesday and said geopolitical uncertainty was slowing demand in the marine market. In a phone interview following the quarterly report, Chief Executive Jaakko Eskola said Wartsila aimed to grow through acquisitions and that it continued to look at Rolls-Royce's RR.L marine business, which the British company is reviewing for a possible sale. Wartsila said the marine sector, which has been hit by overcapacity and lack of financing, was recovering, but not at the pace the company had anticipated. “We are seeing that this geopolitical uncertainty impacts customers’ decision-making ... merchant and offshore segments’ activity is not growing as we had thought,” Eskola said. “It is a concern. Talks about trade war ... they create uncertainty and make customers consider purchases a little longer.” First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) rose 9 percent to 98 million euros (85.8 million pounds), but fell short of the 118 million euros expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. Shares in the company were down 4.3 percent at 0936 GMT. “Wartsila’s profitability was a disappointment ... we had also anticipated an improvement in their (marine) outlook,” said Inderes analyst Erkki Vesola, who has a “reduce” rating on the stock.

"Rolls-Royce could move engine design approval to Germany LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L may transfer the design approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany as a ""technical measure"" to avoid disruption from Brexit, the company said on Monday. Rolls, one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, said in a statement it was working to ensure there was no interruption in its services to customers due to Britain’s departure from the European Union. Aircraft safety and the design approvals process are among the issues that Britain and the EU have yet to settle in their divorce talks. Britain is due to formally leave the bloc in March next year. “As you would expect, we have to consider what contingency measures we may need to take to ensure our operations in the UK and elsewhere can continue, and these may in the future include the transfer of the design approval for our large jet engines from the UK to Germany,” a spokesperson said. “This would be a technical measure as we already seek approval for our business jet engines from Germany, and we do not anticipate such a move would lead to the transfer of any jobs from the UK.” Rolls added that no decision had been taken on whether to press ahead with the plan. Britain wants to remain part of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) after Brexit to ensure airlines and manufacturers of aviation parts based in the country can continue to benefit from cooperation on safety and avoid increased certification costs.

"Rolls-Royce to bid for engines for China-Russia wide body jet - China Daily SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc RR.L will bid to provide engines for a new wide-body jetliner that China is developing with Russia, the China Daily newspaper reported on Saturday, citing the British engineering company. The newspaper, citing Rolls-Royce’s chief technology officer Paul Stein, said the first round of bidding to supply the CR929 liner with engines was expected to begin in May. Chinese state planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is developing the jet with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp, issued the request for a proposal to engine makers in December. “We are taking it very seriously. We want to be the engine provider. The CR929 will invite a lot of positive competition and innovative opportunities to the aviation industry,” Stein was quoted as saying in Beijing. The newspaper also said that Rolls-Royce, the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines behind U.S. group General Electric GE.N, has been in talks about potential cooperation opportunities with Chinese firms, including aero engine manufacturers, without providing further details. Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China has been ploughing billions of dollars into developing jets to raise its profile in global aviation and to disrupt the current Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus SE AIR.PA duopoly. The company, which sent its C919 narrowbody jet on its maiden flights last year, has established a joint venture for the C929 wide-body with an aim to eventually take 10 percent of a market dominated by the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.",2018-04-14 00:00:00,-0.7152759674472925,neutral
"Rolls-Royce and airlines grapple with further Dreamliner engine issues LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce requires more money and more inspections to fix problems with Trent 1000 engines on Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes, leading to further disruption for airlines and testing relations between Rolls and its customers. Problems with engine turbine blades wearing out sooner than expected have hampered a restructuring programme prompted by the engineering company’s declining older engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment. It said on Friday that more regular inspections are required and would lead “to higher than previously guided cash costs being incurred during 2018”. “We sincerely regret the disruption this will cause to our customers,” CEO Warren East said in a statement. Airlines have already been forced to alter schedules or lease other aircraft, but the latest issues could be more far-reaching. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to reduce the amount of time the affected planes can fly on a single engine after a failure of the other. The time limit would drop as low as 140 minutes, compared with the current window of 330 minutes, a source familiar with the plans said. This effectively curtails operations across oceans or remote areas. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will also order increased inspections of affected engines in line with actions outlined by Rolls-Royce. Currently inspections must be carried out after every 200 flight cycles. The two advisories are due to be issued on Friday, the source said. Rolls said it would reprioritise spending to mitigate the costs and kept its 2018 free cash flow guidance unchanged at about 450 million pounds ($643 million), give or take 100 million pounds. Shares in Rolls, one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, were down 1.3 percent by 1251 GMT. It announced the need for stepped up inspections after liaising with authorities over a separate issue with the compressor on Trent 1000 Package C series engines. Rolls said there were 380 such engines in service. Boeing said that about 25 percent of the Dreamliners flying were powered by the engine and it was deploying support teams to help to manage service disruptions. General Electric engines used on some Boeing 787 Dreamliners are not affected. The need to inspect and repair Trent 1000 engines has led to an industry-wide shortage. CEO East said Rolls was working with Boeing and airlines to minimise the disruption. “Our team of technical experts and service engineers is working around the clock to ensure we return them to full service as soon as possible,” he said. Norwegian Air, which has the engines in 15 of its 27 Boeing 787s, said it hopes to have inspected all of its engines before May 26 and that it had already found one problem that required an engine to be replaced. “It’s disappointing and frustrating that our new aircraft don’t work the way they are supposed to,” spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nilsen said, adding that it had cancelled a flight from Paris to New York next week as a result. “We have an ongoing dialogue with both Boeing and Rolls-Royce and we have been told this problem has their full attention.” Virgin Atlantic [VA.UL] has up to four 787s grounded at any one time while it sources replacement engines with Rolls and has also leased three Airbus A330-200s to help to cover its flying programme. A Virgin spokeswoman said it had been aware of the increased inspections announced on Friday and that the cover it had in place would be sufficient. British Airways, Japan’s ANA, Air New Zealand and Thai Airways, which also use Trent 1000 engines, were not available for immediate comment. Scoot, a budget carrier owned by Singapore Airlines, said it expected some impact on operations. In December the EASA ordered airlines to replace some Trent 1000 engines. In March, Rolls said the cash hit from the problem should peak at 340 million pounds in 2018 before falling in 2019. ($1 = 0.6998 pounds)",2018-04-13 00:00:00,-0.3858402126304136,neutral

"Rolls-Royce and Boeing back UK minnow's rocket engine technology LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce RR.L and U.S. planemaker Boeing BA.N have both invested in rocket engine company Reaction Engines as the latest blue-chip companies to back the start-up's thermal management technology. Reaction Engines, based in Oxfordshire, England, said on Thursday that it had raised 26.5 million pounds ($37.7 million)from a range of new investors including Rolls-Royce and Boeing’s investment arm Boeing HorizonX Ventures. They join defense giant and existing investor BAE Systems BAES.L, which increased its investment in the latest fundraising round. Reaction Engines is working on ultra light, miniature and extremely powerful heat exchangers to develop an engine that could power hypersonic planes and help to deliver satellites to space. In the shorter term, however, the company is focusing on commercializing parts of its technology so it can start generating revenue in the next 18 months. Chief Executive Mark Thomas told Reuters that he is initially targeting electric vehicles, energy generation and aero engines. Rolls-Royce, for instance, could use the technology in the next-generation engines it is working on and is keen to explore that area, Thomas said. “Potentially it could enable you to have a more efficient and cleaner, so greener, civil aero engine by improving the thermal dynamics of that engine,” he said.

"FTSE 100 edges up powered by Rolls Royce LONDON (Reuters) - British stocks rose for a third straight session on Wednesday, although gains were tempered by the resignation of U.S. economic advisor Gary Cohn, which rekindled worries the U.S. administration was shifting towards protectionism. The FTSE 100 ended up 0.16 percent at 7,157.84 points, as a rally in engine maker Rolls Royce and gains among industrials more than offset weakness among commodity stocks. “Whilst the rhetoric has clearly increased in recent days, particularly with the timing of Gary Cohn’s departure, the key tests are whether Donald Trump proceeds to sign this order but also what other nations do in response,” said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald in London. Trade fears caused metals prices to slip, driving miners Glencore, Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto down 0.1 to 1.6 percent. Oil prices also tumbled, sending oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell down 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Rolls Royce shares charged ahead, up 11.5 1 percent after its turnaround plan boosted profit ahead of expectations. The sharp rise in share price could be down to investors unwinding short positions in the stock, traders said. Astec Analytics data showed the cost to borrow Rolls Royce shares has risen over the past month, indicating increased interest in shorting the stock leading up to these results. The FTSE banking index edged up 0.1 percent, as the release of draft guidelines for a Brexit trade deal showed the EU would only offer financial services firms in London a limited ability to sell many of their services to European companies.

"Rolls-Royce's progress powers share price rise LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce RR.L said it was on track to meet its 2020 goals after beating forecasts last year, providing evidence that CEO Warren East's plan to rebuild one of the biggest names in British manufacturing was paying off. Shares in aero-engine maker Rolls gained 13 percent to 939 pence on Wednesday, their highest level since November, after its 2017 pretax profit rose 25 percent to 1.071 billion pounds ($1.49 billion), beating a consensus forecast of 878 million pounds. Rolls had recorded a record loss for 2016. East has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programs and plunging demand for oil equipment hit it hard. The company stuck to a goal of generating free cash flow of 1 billion pounds by around 2020, despite the impact of a costly program to repair its Trent 1000 engines. “Looking at today’s announcement, we sense the Rolls-Royce story is finally coming of age,” said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, who has a “Buy” recommendation on the stock. Rolls said it would continue with a cost-cutting strategy, adopted as part of the turnaround, after an earlier plan saved about 200 million pounds over the 2015-2017 period by cutting layers of management and shortening manufacturing times. “The reality is there is more simplification that we need to do to make ourselves truly competitive and fit for the future,” East told reporters on Wednesday. He declined to put a figure on savings from this latest plan but said it would remove duplication and result in “significant cost reduction”. Some 600 senior managers left the company after the initial restructuring. The strong performance in 2017 was driven by a jump in engine deliveries and higher maintenance volumes. Rolls also reported rising sales in its power systems business, which makes engines for use in trains, agriculture and mining. “We’re seeing this as an encouraging set of results,” East said. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the performance should convince any investors still skeptical about East’s plans and the results raised hopes about the dividend, which the company had halved in 2016 to shore up its finances. “The chances of Rolls-Royce meaningfully increasing its returns to shareholders in the years to come look much better now,” he said. Rolls paid out 11.7 pence per share for 2017, unchanged from the previous year. Rolls would take a hit of about 340 million pounds this year to account for the cost of carrying out repairs on existing engines, primarily the Trent 1000 installed on Boeing 787s. “Clearly the engine issues are significant,” said East. “However, we are being transparent with our customers, we’re being transparent with the market. We’re prioritizing resolving the situation for our customers. We have our arms around the solution.” Rolls has said that 400 to 500 Trent 1000 engines were affected by problems with components wearing out earlier than expected, needing extra inspection and maintenance. Air New Zealand, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Japan’s ANA Holdings are amongst those affected. For 2018, Rolls forecast group underlying operating profit of about 400 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds. At the lower end of expectations that would represent a decline from its 2017 level of 321 million pounds. That broad guidance was issued under a new accounting standard, which changes how the company books earnings on long-term contracts. Another part of East’s turnaround plan is the potential sale of the Rolls-Royce’s loss-making commercial marine business, the part of the business which designs and makes equipment used in oil and gas extraction. “At this stage there’s no new news, we’ll update you when we’ve got something to talk about,” Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith told reporters, adding that the update could come in May at its annual meeting or in June at an investor day.",2018-03-07 00:00:00,11.194208443908321,increase

"Boeing completing 787-10 flight tests with GE engines (Reuters) - Boeing Co BA.N has still to complete flight tests on the newly certified 787-10 Dreamliner with General Electric Co GE.N engines, but has finished tests with Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC RR.L engines, a Boeing executive said on Tuesday. The U.S. jet manufacturer on Monday said the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had certified the biggest model of the fuel-efficient Dreamliner for commercial use. The first delivery, to Singapore Airlines Ltd SIAL.SI with Rolls-Royce engines, is due in the first half of the year and will be used on mid-length routes in the Asia Pacific region. United Airlines UAL.N is expected to accept the first 787-10 with GE engines in the second half of the year. “We are complete with all flight testing required for the first deliveries to Singapore and the Rolls-Royce family,” Boeing 787 programme chief project engineer Bob Whittington told reporters on a conference call, speaking from Seattle. “There is a little bit more testing to be done for the GE-powered airplanes a little bit later on.” The 787-10 has 95 percent of its parts in common with the mid-sized Dreamliner, the 787-9. The main differences are in the environmental control system, which is larger due to the longer length of the airplane and higher number of passengers, and in the landing gear, Whittington said. The smaller 787-8 model, the first Dreamliner, has roughly 80 percent commonality with the 787-10 and has been a slower seller as Boeing considers whether to launch a “New Mid-Sized Airplane” with 220-260 seats targeting the market between the 737 MAX 10 and the 787-8. The 787-10 seats around 330 passengers and has a shorter range, at 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 kms), than the other Dreamliners, but Whittington did not rule out extending the range over time. “We will continue to look and see if the market needs a couple of thousand more pounds take-off weight and we will continue those studies,” he said.

"Rolls-Royce shares jump as commercial marine business goes on block LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce is considering the sale of its loss-making commercial marine business in another shake-up by Chief Executive Warren East that will streamline its activities into civil aerospace, defence and power system units. East had resisted selling the marine business, which has been hit by weak offshore oil and gas markets, saying its technology was relevant to other parts of Rolls. The business, which is largely based in the Nordics, had “responded admirably” to the downturn by cutting its cost base, he said, but the case for new investment was “challenging”. “It is only right that we consider whether its future may be better served under new ownership,” he said. Shares in the company jumped to a 10-week high after it said the loss-making business could be sold. They were trading up almost 6 percent at 902.6 pence at 1420 GMT, topping the FTSE 100 index. East said he had previously had to deal with urgent priorities at Rolls-Royce, including introducing new engines and doubling production rates of its engines for wide-body jets, before ordering a review of marine. “We needed to stabilise the business and deliver on the initial simplification to restore trust,” he told reporters. The marine business generated a loss of 27 million pounds on sales of 1.1 billion pounds in 2016, with the bulk of the business supplying equipment and vessel design across the oil and gas, merchant and other commercial markets. The loss widened in Rolls-Royce’s first half to 17 million pounds, when it said the market outlook remained challenging. East said the review was consistent with his previous comments that not everything in the unit was core. “Some of the activities are very useful to us from a future technology point of view,” he said, such as automation. But activities like vessel design could be sold off. Bankers said GE, Wartsila and Siemens were possible buyers. Finance Chief Stephen Daintith said there was interest in the business, but it was too early to talk about the value of a deal before the review, which is being done by Lazard, concludes. “[Marine] has gone through a lot of restructuring,” East said. “It is well placed for a turnaround in its markets, it’s just that the visibility around that is uncertain.” East said the naval shipping business would move into an expanded defence unit. The major overhaul, East’s second since he became CEO in 2015, will also see the elimination of its nuclear division, with nuclear submarine systems moving into defence and civil nuclear activities moving into power systems. East said the changes would enable the company to respond more quickly to the needs of its customers and reduce costs. “It will create a Defence operation with greater scale in the market, enabling us to offer our customers a more integrated range of products and services,” he said. “It will also strengthen our ability to innovate in core technologies and enable us to take advantage of future opportunities in areas such as electrification and digitalisation.” East, who has already stripped out layers of management at Rolls, said the restructuring would remove some duplication, but it was too early to quantify job losses. Cost savings, beyond the 200 million pounds a year it targeted in 2015, and other details about the restructuring will be given in its full-year results in February.",2018-01-17 00:00:00,3.491102253732967,increase

"EASA orders airlines to replace some Rolls-Royce engines FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European aviation safety regulator ordered airlines to replace some Rolls-Royce RR.L Trent 1000 engines on their aircraft as some components are suspected of having corroded. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said, to reduce the risk of both engines shutting down in flight, a new life cycle limit must be applied to 15 engines with specific serial numbers. In cases where a plane has two affected engines installed, airlines must replace one of them, it said in an Emergency Airworthiness Directive published on its website on Thursday. Rolls-Royce told investors in August that 400 to 500 Trent 1000 engines were affected by problems with components wearing out earlier than expected, according to a conference call transcript. The affected engines are primarily installed on Boeing BA.N 787 aircraft, according to EASA. “This directive mandates action we are taking as part of the continual development of our pro-active engine management programme,” a Rolls-Royce spokesman said. Several airlines including Air New Zealand AIR.NZ, British Airways ICAG.L, Virgin Atlantic and Japan's ANA Holdings 9202.T have previously reported problems with Rolls-Royce Trent engines, leading to extra inspection and maintenance and prompting them to cancel or delay some flights. British Airways, ANA, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines' SIAL.SI low-cost arm Scoot said they did not have any of the specific engines referred to in the directive in their fleets. A Boeing spokesman declined immediate comment. The Trent 1000 powered the first 787-8 to enter service in 2011. The latest version of the engine, the Trent 1000 TEN, entered service in November and will power Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft operated by Air New Zealand, Norwegian and Scoot.",2017-12-21 00:00:00,0.6440281030444965,neutral
"Rolls-Royce creates cross-business data unit to drive efficiency LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce has created a data unit, named R2 Data Labs, that uses analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve efficiency across its civil and defense aerospace, marine, nuclear and power systems businesses. Chief digital officer Neil Crockett said the model would deliver a “step change” in the capability of the British company’s data services and would enable it to work more closely with its customers. “R2 Data Labs will tap into expertise from across a wide data and analytics supply chain, building a diverse community of data innovators: including OEM partners, niche start-ups, academics, and a broad range of other trusted third-parties,” he said on Tuesday. Last month Rolls-Royce said it would work with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on building a new digital platform that will help it develop new products quicker - one of the main targets in Chief Executive Warren East’s turnaround plan.",2017-12-12 00:00:00,0.9036144578313252,neutral
